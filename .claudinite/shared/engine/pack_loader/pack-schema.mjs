// THE PACK MANIFEST SPEC — the single declarative statement of what a
// `pack.mjs` may and must carry. Everything a pack declares about itself is
// described here once, and `validateManifest` is the only thing that judges a
// manifest against it. The loader calls it on every pack it imports (canon and a
// consumer's own `local_packs/` alike), so a malformed or incomplete manifest
// surfaces as a blocking `config` error at load — the same class as invalid JSON
// in `.claudinite-settings.json`.
//
// WHY A SPEC AND NOT A CHECK. A required manifest field is part of the pack
// contract, not a conformance opinion about a repo's content: a conformance rule
// would have to be declared BY a pack, run only when that pack is active, and
// re-derive the manifest by reading its source text — enforcing the shape of the
// system from inside one of its members. The spec is upstream of every pack, so
// there is nothing to declare and nothing to parse.
//
// No filesystem, and its one import is the engine's own pure version module: the
// caller supplies the facts from disk (the `skills/` directory listing), so this
// module is pure and testable standalone. Its other half is
// `pack-conventions.mjs`, which reads the pack directory and fills in what the
// tree already says — so by the time a manifest reaches this spec, `id`, `prose`,
// `badge` and `skills` are present whether or not the author wrote them.
import { isDeclaredVersion } from '../version.mjs';

// The routing budget. Both sides of `ruleRoutingGuidance` become one row of the
// pack catalog (packs/directory.GENERATED.md), which a session reads when deciding
// which pack owns a piece of content — so the cap keeps a row scannable: enough for
// a boundary and a pointer to the pack that owns the other side.
export const MAX_ROUTING_WORDS = 20;

// The two conformance scopes. A rule's scope is its PLACEMENT on the manifest —
// `worldRules` audit repo state, `workRules` judge the change and session in
// front of you — so the two runners' partition is declared where a reader of the
// pack can see it, and a rule module never restates (or contradicts) it.

// validated for SHAPE here and enforced by the pack updater, which is the only caller
// that knows what engine version the target repo actually runs.

// A seed op names a template in the pack and where a fresh install puts it. SEEDED,
// NOT CONVERGED: the file becomes the repo's from that moment, and no update ever
// rewrites it — the README pack-badge row is the precedent, seeded at adoption
// precisely so later runs cannot rewrite a member's README (DESIGN §4).
//
// The run-once guarantee is STRUCTURAL, not a flag anyone must remember to set: only
// the install flow reads this field, so an update has nothing to re-run. That is why
// the shape stays this narrow — a general op here would be an update-time hazard
// waiting for a caller.

// someone has to interpret; `breaks` is how an adopter judges whether to do it now;
// `done` is what lets the tracking issue ever be closed. The shape IS the basics rule
// for handing over human-only work, so a pack that declares one declares all of it.

// are validated only when declared. An UNDECLARED field is an error: the spec is
// the closed vocabulary of a pack, so a typo (`rule:`, `skill:`) fails loudly
// instead of being silently ignored forever.
//
// The two version fields are OPTIONAL BY CONTRACT, not by leniency: a member's own
// `local/packs/` are repo-owned and distributed to nobody, so they carry no version
// and no update flow (docs/versioned-updates/DESIGN.md §8). Requiring the field would
// invalidate every local pack in the fleet at once, with nothing to carry the fix.
// Every CANON pack does declare both — asserted by engine-tests/pack-versions.test.mjs,
// which is a canon-side test rather than a conformance rule precisely because it is
// true of this tree only.
