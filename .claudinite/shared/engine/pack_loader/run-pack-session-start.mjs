// SessionStart step: run every ACTIVE pack's own `session-start.mjs` and forward
// what it prints into the session context.
//
// THE SYMMETRIC HALF OF THE SessionEnd RUNNER (engine/hooks/session-end-command.mjs),
// on the same terms: a step is discovered STRUCTURALLY — a pack ships the file or it
// doesn't — activation-gated by the repo's declaration, bounded, and fail-soft. Core
// never names the pack whose step it runs and never learns what one does. The one
// difference is the direction the output travels: a session-end step's output is a
// log line, and a session-start step's output IS the contribution, so it is forwarded
// to stdout (which SessionStart adds to the session context).
//
// WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL, given pack prose already loads every session: prose is a
// FILE, fixed at vendor time and identical for every repo and every person that
// mounts it. Some pack content can only be known when the session starts — content
// that lives outside this repo, or that is keyed to the person in front of it. A
// pack that needs that has, until now, had nowhere to put it: its choices were a
// static file that cannot say the thing, or a core step that names the pack, which
// is the coupling the pack system exists to prevent. This closes that gap once,
// generically, rather than growing a bespoke core step per pack.
//
// THE COST IT IMPOSES, and the two bounds that keep it honest. A step is a
// subprocess on the session-start path, and its output lands in a finite context
// window. So: every step is killed at CLAUDINITE_PACK_STEP_TIMEOUT_MS, and its
// contribution is capped at CLAUDINITE_PACK_STEP_MAX_BYTES with the truncation
// stated in the injected text. Neither is a knob a pack can raise — they are the
// engine's terms for lending out the session's start.
//
// PLAIN TEXT ONLY, like every other step: one hook's stdout must never mix JSON and
// prose, and nothing here may emit a halt directive on a step's behalf. A step that
// fails, hangs, or exits non-zero yields one note naming the pack, and the session
// proceeds — exit 0, always, because a non-zero exit makes Claude Code discard the
// orchestrator's whole stdout, including the steps that did work.
//
// THE FACET CHANNEL. A step may also state one short phrase about what it loaded —
// `CLAUDINITE-FACET: 450 personal preference tokens` on a line of its own. Those lines
// are lifted out of the step's contribution and appended to the file
// CLAUDINITE_SESSION_FACETS names, where the summary step (session-summary.mjs)
// folds them into the one line a session opens with. It rides the step, and not a
// manifest field, because the facts worth stating are the ones a pack had to
// COMPUTE at session time — a static count is already in the prose the reader has.
// No channel configured, or a file that cannot be written: the facet is dropped and
// the step's own contribution is unaffected.
