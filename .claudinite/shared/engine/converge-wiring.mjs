// Fresh-path wiring convergence (task-code-work DESIGN §7, the primitive absorbed from
// #405). The deterministic half of the self-refresh that has nothing to do with the
// vendored mount's CONTENT: the repo-specific wiring EVERY Claudinite member carries,
// converged idempotently in code so the nightly refresh never needs a model to re-enact
// bootstrap's prose.
//
// DISTRIBUTION WIRING ONLY. What a member needs in order to receive and load pack
// content — the settings hooks, the rules index and the CLAUDE.md import that loads it,
// the .gitattributes entries, the badge row, the repo's own local pack. Scheduling
// wiring is not here: the two workflow files belong to the mechanism that runs them and
// are scaffolded at adoption by the tasks pack (#1317), so a member without that pack
// converges exactly this and nothing about a queue it does not have.
//
// One source of truth: bootstrap Part 5 describes this same set for a fresh adoption;
// this module is what both bootstrap and the update flows CALL, so the wiring can never
// drift between "how a repo is set up" and "how the nightly keeps it set up".
//
// Operates on a repo working tree at `root` with node:fs directly (like
// apply-vendor-set.mjs), returning a summary of what it changed — idempotent: a
