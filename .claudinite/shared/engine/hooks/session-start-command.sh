# SessionStart orchestrator — the ONE place the corpus-dependent session-start
# steps run, IN SEQUENCE, in a single process.
#
# Why this exists: Claude Code runs hook entries IN PARALLEL with
# non-deterministic order ("all matching hooks run in parallel… the order is
# non-deterministic" — the Claude Code hooks docs). So a populate-then-read
# chain spread across separate SessionStart entries is a race, not a sequence —
# the cause of intermittent "the harness didn't load this session" reports.
# Everything that reads the corpus therefore runs HERE, in order. The corpus is
# always already present: a consumer's tracked vendored mount, or the canon
# checkout itself.
#
# Each step's stdout is forwarded to this hook's stdout, which SessionStart adds
# to the session context (a pack's own session-start step, halt-and-ask directives,
# the summary line) — everything a session can only learn at session time. Static pack
# prose is NOT here and must not come back: it rides CLAUDE.md, on a channel that does
# not truncate (#807, and the missing step above).
# Progress — a timestamp and what it is doing — is written to .claudinite-hooks.log and to
# stderr, so a triggering failure (no lines at all) reads differently from an
# execution failure (a step logged `start` but not `done`).
#
# Always exits 0: a SessionStart hook cannot block, and a non-zero exit makes
# Claude Code DISCARD this hook's stdout — including any step's halt-and-ask
# directive, the load-bearing safety gate. Failure is surfaced via the log and
# the injected directives, never the exit code.
