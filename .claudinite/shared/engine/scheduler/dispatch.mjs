// The dispatch issue — how a due (task, slot) becomes exactly-once, bounded,
// recoverable agent work (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §4). This module is the
// PURE half: issue identity (title/body/parse) and the create / skip / suppress
// decision over the issues that already exist. A thin scheduler shell does the
// GitHub I/O (search state=all, create, label, comment) and applies the verdict
// — the "should I file this" decision is always code here, never the shell's
// judgment (the same split the fleet planner uses).
//
// All behavior-defining content (agent_model, expected_outcome, agent_instructions) is read from the
// tracked task files, never from the issue — the body only points at the task
// file and carries the precondition's binding Context (DESIGN §4).

// The labels this machinery drives. `ready-for-agent` is what the executor
// routine fires on; `needs-human` is the single triage state every anomaly
// converges to (DESIGN §4 lifecycle). Kept here as the shared source for the
// scheduler side; the executor reuses these plus `agent-running`.
export const READY_LABEL = 'ready-for-agent';
// A fleet-scoped task (session_scope: 'fleet') dispatches to a DISTINCT ready
// label so a separate, broader-scoped executor routine runs it — keeping the

// per-project-scheduling fleet/self split). Only tasks that reach other repos use
// this; today just growth-promote.

// one exists (create-if-missing, idempotent) right before it dispatches — so there
// is no separate label-creation step to run or forget, and a deleted label
// self-heals on the next run. This is load-bearing, not cosmetic: GitHub does not
// create a label when you apply it (the issues API 422s on an unknown label), so
// the thing that assigns a label must guarantee it first — the

// the scheduler's hourly pass, and now runs from the daily task-janitor task —
// still deterministic code, still decided by the pure rules here. The sweep had EVERY triggered session also process every
// OTHER armed issue, so one scheduler run filing N dispatches produced N sessions
// each racing over the same N issues, and the claim swap could not stop it (every
// session read the work list before any claim landed). That is the
