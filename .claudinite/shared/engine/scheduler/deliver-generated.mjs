// Deliver GENERATED files on a pull request that lands itself — the write half of
// an agentless task whose whole output is a regenerated file.
//
// It exists because two tasks need exactly this and must not each grow their own
// copy: the per-repo skill-usage fold and the fleet-enforcer's cross-repo aggregate both
// recompute a `*.GENERATED.json` from scratch and want it landed without a human in
// the loop. (the update runner's own delivery is deliberately NOT folded in here: it
// commits a whole working tree and re-cuts a dated family branch each cycle — a
// different job that happens to end in a PR too. What the two DO share — every
// nuance of actually landing the PR under the member's `maintenance.delivery` and
// the repo's own shape — lives in land-pr.mjs, and both call it.)
//
// Two properties everything here is shaped around:
//
//   NOTHING TOUCHES THE CHECKOUT. One executor run drains several items from ONE
//   checkout, so a task that checks a branch out hands the next one a tree it did not
//   expect.
//   Every write goes through git plumbing (hash-object / read-tree into a throwaway
//   index / write-tree / commit-tree / push), against the fetched base tip — HEAD,
//   the index and the working tree are never touched, and there is nothing to clean
//   up if the run dies.
//
//   THE BASE IS THE ONLY AUTHORITY. Both the prior state a generator reads and the
//   tree it builds on come from the remote base branch, never from local HEAD. A
//   previous run's PR still sitting open is simply rebuilt from the base, so a
//   stateless generator stays idempotent no matter how many runs stack up. The
//   member's delivery preference is read from the base too, for the same reason.
//
// Idempotence is the caller's to keep: pass files whose content is a pure function of
// the inputs, and compare against `readAtBase` before calling — an identical
// recompute should open nothing at all.
