// The one vendored place that computes a repo's stable scheduler cron MINUTE
// (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §3). The per-repo scheduler workflow runs hourly
// on a repo-hashed minute constrained to :10–:50 — spreading the fleet across the
// band, dodging GitHub's :00 stampede, and staying clear of the hour boundary the
// anchor arithmetic works from.
//
// This is the minute the stub's placeholder (`cron: '10 * * * *'`) is rewritten to
// when the workflow lands in a repo: bootstrap assigns it, and the update flows'
// self-refresh preserves it (the one repo-specific value in the otherwise-identical
// vendored stub). Deriving it from the full name — not storing it — means any
// session can recompute the canonical value and detect drift.
//
// Self-contained by the engine's module rule: imports nothing, so bootstrap, the
// update runner, and a human can load or run it standalone.

// The inclusive minute band. 41 slots (10..50) — the widest window that clears the
// :00 stampede and the hour boundary on both sides.

// FNV-1a over the lowercased full name → a minute in [MINUTE_MIN, MINUTE_MAX].
// Same hash family as the retired central planner's weekday bucket: deterministic,
// well-spread, and Math.imul keeps the multiply in 32-bit range. Keyed on the repo
// full name ("owner/repo") so the value is stable across re-vendors and re-derivable
// anywhere the name is known.
