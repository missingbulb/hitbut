// The scheduling CALENDAR — the frequency vocabulary and the anchor arithmetic
// (tasks-dispatch DESIGN §5). Pure and stateless: given the repo's `schedule`
// anchor (dailyHour, weeklyDay, monthlyDay), a frequency and a `now`, it answers
// exactly one question — WHEN is that frequency's most recent occurrence at or
// before `now`.
//
// There is no occurrence IDENTITY here, and that is the point: under the
// work-item queue an occurrence is identified by the item's issue number, so the
// calendar owns the instants and nothing else. `queue/anchors.mjs` is the only
// consumer of the arithmetic; the vocabulary below is what the task contract and
// the author-time declaration check read.
//
// All times are UTC (the `schedule` values are UTC by contract). This module
// never reads the clock itself — `now` is always injected — so every answer is
// deterministic and testable.

// The legal frequency tokens — the vocabulary the runtime contract validates
// against and the author-time declaration check rejects anything outside.
//
// `manual` is the one non-cadence: a manual task has no occurrence at all, so the
// scheduler run never instantiates it and it runs only from an item created by hand
// (`queue/create-work-item.mjs`). It exists for operator levers — work that
// answers no recurring question but wants a task's whole apparatus (declaration,
// contract validation, code-work, the work item) when a human pulls it.
