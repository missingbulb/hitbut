//     Nothing scheduled runs "for nothing" on a repo nobody is working on.
//   - NO FLEET CEREMONY. Whatever looks at this repo from the OUTSIDE reads the
//     same declaration and leaves it alone rather than reporting it as unhealthy —
//     a repo TOLD to stop keeping up must not then be nagged for not keeping up.
//     Which is why this predicate is exported for a raw declaration too (below).
