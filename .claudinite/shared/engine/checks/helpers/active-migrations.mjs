// The synchronous migration-registry surface for the CHECK layer. It lives in
// the engine lib because pack checks consult it (`migrationActive` gates an
// in-flight transition's legacy tolerance) and a pack imports only its own files
// and the engine surface (pack-independence). Self-locating relative to the
// engine root, so in a vendored consumer — where a mount carries only the recent
// vendored records, or none — every query answers from what the mount actually
// holds. The full registry (engine/migrations/registry.mjs) builds on this same
// surface canon-side.
//
// TWO HOMES, ONE SHAPE. A record belongs to the flow that owns it: an engine
// migration lives at `engine/migrations/<landed-date>-<slug>/`, a pack's at
// `packs/<pack>/migrations/<landed-date>-<slug>/`, each with its spec at
// migration.mjs (docs/versioned-updates/DESIGN.md §3.7). Discovery walks both,
// so a caller never has to know which flow raised a record — and the split is
// what lets each flow fetch, and later version-range, only its own.
//
// All records are equal — there is no active/archived split and no cleanup pass;
// FETCHING decides relevance. Vendoring ships only the records landed within
// RECENT_WINDOW_DAYS, so an up-to-date consumer carries few-to-none, while a
// lagging project updating out of a fresh canon clone sees them all and
