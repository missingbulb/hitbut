// The declarative pattern-check engine: a rule whose whole logic is "these
// patterns over these files" is DECLARED as data — and data is JSON, not code.
// A pack's declarations live in `packs/<pack>/declared-checks.json` (a skill's
// in `<pack>/skills/<name>/declared-checks.json`), an array of specs the pack
// registry discovers structurally and compiles here into ordinary
// `{ id, severity, why, run(ctx) }` rule objects the runner treats like any
// other. Nothing wires them: dropping a declaration into the file adds it.
//
// The format admits no comments — the pattern plus its failureMessage/what/fix
// text IS the check — and no prose pointers: a declaration states its own case
// or it isn't finished. So a spec carries exactly:
//   id              the rule id settings and findings name it by
//   severity        'blocking' | 'advisory'
//   since           optional 'YYYY-MM-DD' — the date this check was added. A
//                   blocking check is enforced as advisory for its first
//                   GRACE_DAYS from it (helpers/findings.mjs), so a check can
//                   land against a tree that still violates it.
//   failureMessage  why this matters, printed on every finding the rule makes
//   …the assertions below, each with the `what` and `fix` it fails with
//
// REGEXES ARE STRINGS in `/body/flags` form — "/^\\s*schedule:/m" — compiled at
// load. Keys that accept a path instead (scanFiles, excludeFiles, pathExists)
// read any other string as an exact repo path; at every other pattern key a
// string that is not in `/…/` form is an authoring error, reported as one.
// The engine owns only the walking (the mechanism/policy line line-scanning.mjs
// draws): every pattern, file filter, and failure text stays in the declaration.
// Spec keys are deliberately wordy — a declaration must read as the whole check
// without this header.
//
// Built for MANY such rules at once: however many pattern rules a run holds,
// the engine makes ONE pass over the scanned tree — each file is read once and
// its lines split once, with every subscribing rule's assertions evaluated in
// that single visit — and the per-context results are cached, so the first
// pattern rule the runner reaches pays for the whole family and the rest are
// lookups. Regexes must be non-global (`.test` on a /g regex is stateful).
//
// A key the vocabulary cannot place is DROPPED at load, not thrown on: it is a
// typo (asserting nothing, silently) or a key a newer engine knows, and the load
// cannot tell them apart. Refusing it would wedge the second case — a member's
// pack lane and engine lane converge on separate cycles, so a declaration can
// legitimately reach an engine older than its vocabulary, and the converge that
// would deliver the newer engine is itself gated on the load (#1400). The typo is
// caught instead by the `declared-check-spec-keys` world rule, advisory where the
// skew is possible and blocking in the canon, where engine and declarations ship
// from one commit. A key the engine DOES place keeps its loud failure on a broken
// value (an uncompilable regex, a malformed date): that is not skew, it is broken.
//
// The spec vocabulary — everything beyond the rule metadata is optional:
//   fix                rule-level default: any assertion declaring `what` but
//                      no `fix` of its own inherits this one (for rules whose
//                      every assertion shares one remedy)
//   scope              "work" = this declaration judges the CHANGE rather than
//                      the repo, so it runs in check_the_work and may carry the
//                      work assertions below. Absent = world scope, the default
//                      (the pack manifest's own two rule lists say the same
//                      thing for a coded rule — a declaration has no list to
//                      sit in, so it states its scope here)
//   scanFiles          which files the content assertions read, in one of three
//                      forms: a RegExp over repo paths, one exact path (read
//                      directly), or an object naming the files ANOTHER parsed
//                      document points at —
//                        { inParsedFilesMatching, whereFileContains,
//                          namedByField, defaultingTo, withSuffix }
//                      every tracked document `inParsedFilesMatching` (refined
//                      by the `whereFileContains` probe) is parsed, the string
//                      at `namedByField` read from it — an array anywhere along
//                      that field path fans out over its entries, and
//                      `defaultingTo` supplies the name when the field's own
//                      parent is there without it — and each name, plus any
//                      `withSuffix`, resolved against the NAMING file's
//                      directory. A name pointing outside the scan set is
//                      dropped silently: a check has nothing to say about a
//                      file this checkout does not carry
//   scanFileClasses    named shared file sets widening the scan scope (unioned
//                      with a RegExp scanFiles): javascriptFiles, pythonFiles,
//                      markdownFiles, workflowFiles, testFiles
//   excludeFileClasses named shared file sets removed from scope (the same

//                      (string-aware, line count preserved — code-scanning.mjs

//   checkBranchCommits [{ someMessageMatches, unlessOnDefaultBranch, what, fix }]
//                      one finding at "(branch)" when NO commit message since
//                      the base matches; a branch carrying no commits of its
//                      own asserts nothing, and unlessOnDefaultBranch exempts
//                      main/master. {commits} (the count) and {base} interpolate
//   forbidIntroducedMergeCommits { what, fix }
//                      one finding per merge commit the change introduces —
//                      merges already on the base are the repo's history, not
//                      the work — anchored at "<branch>@<sha>"; {sha} and
//                      {subject} interpolate
//   forbidAddedValueInArray [{ file | filesMatching (+ whereFileContains),
//                              atFields, what, fix }]
//                      one finding per value the change ADDS to any of the JSON
//                      arrays at `atFields`, comparing the parsed head against
//                      the parsed base — a set comparison, never the text diff,
//                      because appending an array element re-touches the line
//                      above it. An unparsable head asserts nothing; an absent
//                      base makes every value an addition. {value} interpolates
//
// The reference-barrier assertion — a directed folder-access graph enforced by
// the reference-scanning engine (helpers/reference-scanning.mjs, which owns the
// edge vocabulary's semantics):
//   forbidReferences   [{ from | between | siblings, to, scope, allow, except,
//                         matchNames, alsoMatchNames, matchUniqueFilenames,
//                         reason }]
//                      each entry one barrier edge, normalized at load (a
//                      malformed edge is an authoring error); the rule's
//                      failureMessage is the why (an edge's `reason` overrides
//                      it), and a rule-level `fix` replaces the engine's
//                      composed crossing remedy
//
// The markdown-section assertions read each scanned page's `## ` sections —
// headings matched case-insensitively with suffix words allowed, fenced code
// blocks invisible, a section running to the next `## ` heading or EOF. A
// top-level bullet is a column-0 `-`/`*`/`+` line; a bullet BLOCK is the bullet
// plus its indented continuation lines; a DATED bullet leads with its
// YYYY-MM-DD run date, bold or plain, validated as a real calendar date. Every
// assertion except requirePresent asserts nothing when the section is absent
// (presence is its own declared finding, never double-reported):
//   checkSections      [{ section | sections: [names], … }] with, each optional:
//                        requirePresent                   the `## {section}` heading must exist
