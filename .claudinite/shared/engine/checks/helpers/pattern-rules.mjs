// The declarative pattern-check engine: a rule whose whole logic is "these
// patterns over these files" is DECLARED as data — and data is JSON, not code.
// A pack's declarations live in `packs/<pack>/declared-checks.json` (a skill's
// in `<pack>/skills/<name>/declared-checks.json`), an array of specs the pack
// registry discovers structurally and compiles here into ordinary
// `{ id, severity, why, run(ctx) }` rule objects the runner treats like any
// other. Nothing wires them: dropping a declaration into the file adds it.
//
// The format admits no comments — the pattern plus its failureMessage/what/fix
// text IS the check — and no prose pointers: a declaration states its own case
// or it isn't finished. So a spec carries exactly:
//   id              the rule id settings and findings name it by
//   severity        'blocking' | 'advisory'
//   since           optional 'YYYY-MM-DD' — the date this check was added. A
//                   blocking check is enforced as advisory for its first
//                   GRACE_DAYS from it (helpers/findings.mjs), so a check can
//                   land against a tree that still violates it.
//   failureMessage  why this matters, printed on every finding the rule makes
//   …the assertions below, each with the `what` and `fix` it fails with
//
// REGEXES ARE STRINGS in `/body/flags` form — "/^\\s*schedule:/m" — compiled at
// load. Keys that accept a path instead (scanFiles, excludeFiles, pathExists)
// read any other string as an exact repo path; at every other pattern key a
// string that is not in `/…/` form is an authoring error, reported as one.
// The engine owns only the walking (the mechanism/policy line line-scanning.mjs
// draws): every pattern, file filter, and failure text stays in the declaration.
// Spec keys are deliberately wordy — a declaration must read as the whole check
// without this header.
//
// Built for MANY such rules at once: however many pattern rules a run holds,
// the engine makes ONE pass over the scanned tree — each file is read once and
// its lines split once, with every subscribing rule's assertions evaluated in
// that single visit — and the per-context results are cached, so the first
// pattern rule the runner reaches pays for the whole family and the rest are
// lookups. Regexes must be non-global (`.test` on a /g regex is stateful).
//
// A key the vocabulary cannot place is DROPPED at load, not thrown on: it is a
// typo (asserting nothing, silently) or a key a newer engine knows, and the load
// cannot tell them apart. Refusing it would wedge the second case — a member's
// pack lane and engine lane converge on separate cycles, so a declaration can
// legitimately reach an engine older than its vocabulary, and the converge that
// would deliver the newer engine is itself gated on the load (#1400). The typo is
// caught instead by the `declared-check-spec-keys` world rule, advisory where the
// skew is possible and blocking in the canon, where engine and declarations ship
// from one commit. A key the engine DOES place keeps its loud failure on a broken
// value (an uncompilable regex, a malformed date): that is not skew, it is broken.
//
// The spec vocabulary — everything beyond the rule metadata is optional:
//   fix                rule-level default: any assertion declaring `what` but
//                      no `fix` of its own inherits this one (for rules whose
//                      every assertion shares one remedy)
//   scope              "work" = this declaration judges the CHANGE rather than
//                      the repo, so it runs in check_the_work and may carry the
//                      work assertions below. Absent = world scope, the default
//                      (the pack manifest's own two rule lists say the same
//                      thing for a coded rule — a declaration has no list to
//                      sit in, so it states its scope here)
//   scanFiles          which files the content assertions read, in one of three
//                      forms: a RegExp over repo paths, one exact path (read
//                      directly), or an object naming the files ANOTHER parsed
//                      document points at —
//                        { inParsedFilesMatching, whereFileContains,
//                          namedByField, defaultingTo, withSuffix }
//                      every tracked document `inParsedFilesMatching` (refined
//                      by the `whereFileContains` probe) is parsed, the string
//                      at `namedByField` read from it — an array anywhere along
//                      that field path fans out over its entries, and
//                      `defaultingTo` supplies the name when the field's own
//                      parent is there without it — and each name, plus any
//                      `withSuffix`, resolved against the NAMING file's
//                      directory. A name pointing outside the scan set is
//                      dropped silently: a check has nothing to say about a
//                      file this checkout does not carry
//   scanFileClasses    named shared file sets widening the scan scope (unioned
//                      with a RegExp scanFiles): javascriptFiles, pythonFiles,
//                      markdownFiles, workflowFiles, testFiles
//   excludeFileClasses named shared file sets removed from scope (the same
//                      class names — testFiles is the usual one)

//                      (string-aware, line count preserved — code-scanning.mjs

//   scanTracked        true = scan every git-tracked file (mode-independent);

//                      is every entry's scanFiles). A line source reads the

//                      every file inFilesMatching selects — through the rule's

//                      splitValuesOn splits one capture into several values. A
//                      path source reads the `value` group of every tracked
//                      path the regex hits (the whole path without one). The
//                      added-lines source is the line source over the lines
//                      the change adds. Every value carries its ORIGIN — the

//                      groups of the path and line regexes that found it, and

//                      declared, never defaulted: "assertNothing" makes every

//                      reports the empty set itself at its source — two

//                      the value's named groups fill it, regex-escaped so a
//                      value is matched as the text it is — unless
//                      valueIsPattern, which inserts {value} raw because the
//                      value IS a regex — a value in /body/flags form
//                      contributes its body, so /{value}/ is the template that
//                      audits other declarations' patterns. A require finding
//                      anchors at the
//                      value's origin; a forbid finding at the file that still

//                      ({other} = the matching value's origin under
//                      mustNotBeIn). Sets meet on value equality, so a join on a

// it run and injects the text as context, so the bias is heard at the moment it

// records, one finding per offending call: the backstop for a hook that never
// fired, and the count the usage fold reads.

//                      failureMessage is the why (an edge's `reason` overrides
//                      it), and a rule-level `fix` replaces the engine's
//                      composed crossing remedy

// The markdown-section assertions read each scanned page's `## ` sections —
