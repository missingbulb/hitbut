// The Claudinite SELF-TEST — "can Claudinite run here?", and nothing else.
//
// Deliberately NOT a conformance check. `check_the_world` judges the repo's
// CONTENT against the rules; this judges whether the MACHINERY that would run
// those rules is intact. A repo can be perfectly conformant and still have a
// broken mount, a hook pointing at a file that no longer exists, or a pack whose
// manifest the loader silently drops — and every one of those is invisible to a
// content check, because a rule that never runs reports nothing.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. Every fleet-wide failure this corpus has had was of that shape:
//
//   #397  inject-pack-prose imported a module that did not exist, so every
//         active pack's RULES.md was silently un-injected, fleet-wide, for days
//   #518  loadConfig dropped the mount stamp, so the nightly converge self-skipped
//         everywhere and no run ever said so
//   #555  a required manifest field landed with no migration; consumer packs
//         stopped validating, and (because normalizeManifest rebuilds `rules`
//         from the scoped lists) their checks stopped running silently
//   #424  five mounted skill links dangled on main, unnoticed
//
// None was caught by canon CI, because the canon's own tree is always already
// correct. All four are assertions below, and each would have fired on the first
// session after the change — on the member, where the damage was.
//
// CONTRACT. Fast (no network, no clone), read-only, and it never throws: a probe
// that cannot run is a FAILED probe with the reason attached, never a crash that
// takes the session-start orchestrator down with it.
//
// Pure core + thin I/O shell, the corpus idiom: `report()` takes plain probe
// results and decides the outcome, so the whole decision surface is testable
// without a repo on disk.
