// tidy-repo task: tidy-branches — the read-only branch third of the tidy sweep
// (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §6). One weekly full sweep over the repo's open
// branches: which carry genuine unmerged work, which are safe to delete. Recommends;
// never deletes. Worker: task.md. Issues and PRs are separate tasks — one dimension
// per task, each with its own trigger, scope, and tracker, so there is no ordering
// barrier.
//
// WEEKLY, and full every time it runs — but it only runs when a branch actually
// MOVED in the window. Branch cruft accumulates on a weekly clock, not a daily one,
// and the verdict is a standing recommendation for a human rather than a same-day
// alert, so the full sweep is a frequency DECLARATION, never a gate trick inside a
// daily task (DESIGN §3). What the sweep is NOT is unconditional: re-deriving the
// same verdicts over an unchanged pile of branches costs an agent run and produces a
// tracker rewrite identical to last week's. Scope stays full because a verdict is
// relative to the others (superseded-by, already-in-main); the GATE is newness.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.

// Branches the tidy review must never assess. Beyond the default branch, the orphan
// `conversation-logs` branch is a claudinite-growth artifact (the captured-transcript
// stream, not project work) — it shares no history with main, so single-branch-status
// would flag it "orphaned" for a human on every run. It is infrastructure the tidy
// sweep ignores altogether. Kept as a bare literal, not an import: the pack-independence
// barrier forbids tidy-repo from reaching into claudinite-growth, and the name is a
// fixed, well-known one. The stable maintenance branch is likewise never a tidy target —
// it is Claudinite's own standing delivery branch, not project work.
const IGNORED_BRANCHES = new Set(['conversation-logs', 'claudinite/maintenance']);

// A precondition has no repo handle, so it cannot look up the actual default branch
// name to drop it from the candidate set — and the `branches` signal carries every
// open branch, the default included. Presuming the conventional default names here
// keeps a repo whose only branch is its default from firing this task at all, which is
// the whole point of the gate. The worker (task.md) remains the authority that never
// assesses the repo's real default branch, so a repo whose default is unconventionally
// named is still safe — its default just also becomes a (cheap, read-only) candidate.
const PRESUMED_DEFAULT = new Set(['main', 'master']);

  // Two gates, in order. Is there a branch worth assessing at all — a repo carrying
  // nothing but its default branch (and the infra branches) stays silent. Then: did
  // any of them MOVE in the window. An unchanged set of branches yields the same
  // verdicts it yielded last run, so re-deriving them buys nothing; the standing
  // picture already lives in the tracker. When something did move, scope is still
  // the FULL set — a branch's verdict is relative to the others (superseded-by,
  // already-in-main), so assessing the new one alone would be assessing it blind.
