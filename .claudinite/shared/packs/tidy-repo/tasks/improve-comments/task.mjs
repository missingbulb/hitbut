// tidy-repo task: improve-comments — the one tidy dimension whose subject is the
// repo's own source rather than its GitHub objects. The other three assess or act
// on issues, PRs and branches; this one reads a slice of the code AS COMMENTS and
// fixes what it finds there. Worker: task.md, which runs the improve-comments skill
// and nothing else.
//
// WHY IT IS A TASK AT ALL: a comment decays as the code around it changes and
// nothing makes it fail. No test goes red, no check fires, and no session working on
// something else will stop to fix one. The only way a repo's comments get read as
// comments is a pass whose whole job that is.
//
// WEEKLY. Comment drift is not latency-sensitive — a stale comment costs the next
// reader, whenever that is — and the window's commits are what name the files whose
// comments are likeliest wrong, so a weekly window is a bigger and better-targeted
// scope than a daily one for the same session cost.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.

  // `.claudinite/` is the mount, not the repo's source: `shared/` is vendored and

  // the WRITE in this pack's `improve-comments-scope` check, and the test beside
  // that check pins the two together — a scope this declaration hands out but the
  // gate then refuses is the failure the pin exists for.
