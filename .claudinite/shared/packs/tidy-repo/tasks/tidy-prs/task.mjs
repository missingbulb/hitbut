// tidy-repo task: tidy-prs — the read-only PR half of the tidy sweep
// (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §6). One weekly full sweep over every open PR:
// which should stay open, which are closeable. Recommends; never closes. Worker:
// task.md. Issues are a separate task — one dimension per task, each with its own
// trigger, scope, and tracker, so there is no ordering barrier.
//
// WEEKLY, and full every time it runs — but it only runs when a PR actually moved
// in the window. A PR verdict is a standing recommendation for a human, not a
// same-day alert, so re-deriving the whole picture once a week beats a daily partial
// one — and "weekly" is a frequency DECLARATION, never a gate trick inside a daily
// task (DESIGN §3). What "full" does not mean is unconditional: an untouched set of
// open PRs yields last week's verdicts again, so the sweep is gated on newness even
// though its scope stays full.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.

  // Two gates, in order. Is there anything open to assess — a repo with no open PRs
  // stays silent. Then: did any open PR get opened or updated in the window. If none
  // did, the picture is the one the tracker already holds and another pass would
  // rewrite it with itself. When one did move, scope is still the FULL open set: a
  // PR verdict is relative to the others (superseded-by), so the mover cannot be
  // judged alone. `touched` counts the newly OPENED ones too — the collector derives
  // it from the open listing's `updated_at`, which a new PR carries.
