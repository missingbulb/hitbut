# wiki-growth

## Why the declaration reads as it does

Carried over from the declaration's comments when it became `task.json`.

product-wiki task: wiki-growth — one research-and-refine pass over the repo's
product wikis (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §6). Worker: task.md.

WEEKLY, not daily and not commit-gated: research arrives on the world's clock,
not the repo's, and a nightly high-model pass economically pressures
fabrication (the Karpathy LLM-wiki cadence). The `commits` signal is declared
only so the precondition can note recent product-relevant movement in context;
the run itself is scheduled by frequency, not triggered by a commit.

The pending-wiki-change gate lives HERE, in the precondition (DESIGN §12: the
precondition is the ONLY decision point — it used to be a task.md preflight,
which was the agentic phase deciding to skip a run its precondition had
already granted). It is not subsumed by the queue: the queue guards at most one
live ITEM per task — it never looks at pull requests, and a completed run closes
its item while leaving the growth PR open for review. This gate is the only thing standing between an unreviewed
PR and a second round of research stacked on top of it.

The wiki tree, root-anchored: the prefix this precondition both declines on
(a pending change to it) and adds context for (a landed change to it), and the
scope of what the round's own PR may land unreviewed.
Research about the world, but worth nothing on a repo nobody works in — and
never a second unreviewed round stacked on a wiki change already in flight.
Markdown, and only inside the tree the round is allowed to grow: `&&` is the
intersection, so a doc elsewhere in the repo and a non-doc file inside the
wiki both park the round for review. On a member whose mount predates this
vocabulary the policy reads as invalid, which is the same park — never a
wider merge.
