# Version history

Records for `packs/node/pack.mjs`'s `version` field, one row per bump — added going forward from
the version this file was introduced beside (60820.1); earlier bumps are not backfilled.

| Version | Date | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| 60823.1 | 2026-08-23 | Names the member settings file by its current name in its config prose (#1252). |
| 60822.1 | 2026-08-22 | The manifest stops restating its own tree (#1246): `id`, `prose`, `badge`, `skills`, `worldRules` and `workRules` are resolved from the pack directory and an absent `detect`/`marker` means no fingerprint. Coded rules move into `worldRules/`/`workRules/` and tests into `test/`, which no vendor set ships. `minEngineVersion` rises to the engine release that reads all of it. |
| 60901.1 | 2026-09-01 | Recovers the rationale #467 cut from two rules into a new `references.md`; both jsdom claims are verified empirically against jsdom 30.0.1, including that `body.innerText` is `undefined` rather than `null` (#1571). |
