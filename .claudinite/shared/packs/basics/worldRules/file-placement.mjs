// The third exemption is the plugin-contract one, and unlike the two above it is a
// property of the reference, not of the source file: a pack module must import the
// engine surface to do its job at all (a rule needs `finding`, a task check needs the
// task contract), and neither end of that reference can move. The pack loader discovers
// packs at fixed paths (packs/, .claudinite/local/packs/), and the engine is vendored
// canon a consumer doesn't own to restructure. So the distance is fixed by the contract,
// not chosen: 4-5 from a pack in the canon home, 7 from a local pack beside a consumer's
// shared mount. Every pack module ever written takes it, which is what makes it
// structural rather than a placement to fix — a project can only ever waive it.
//
// `engineSurface` is the same allow list `pack-independence` enforces (packs may import
// their own files and this surface, nothing else), so "what a pack may import" and "what
// placement exempts" cannot drift apart. That leaves the rule's real work on packs
// intact: a reach into another pack, or deep into a pack's own subtree, is judged
// normally — as is ordinary code reaching *into* a pack, the same one-directional
// narrowness the mandated-location exemption has.
