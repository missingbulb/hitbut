// Data-driven drift guard for a value that must be copied across files that can't
// share an import (a label spanning a YAML workflow guard and a JS module; a repo
// slug in prod code and its test). The cases are declared per-repo in
// .claudinite-settings.json under "sharedConstants"; an empty/absent list is a no-op.
// Each entry is { what, value, counts } — value is the literal, counts maps a
// repo-relative path to the exact number of times it must appear, and what names
// the places and why the split is forced (so the guard self-documents). A count
// mismatch means a rename touched some copies but not all.
//
// A value that must stay in sync but *changes over time* (a version string bumped
// each release) sets "regex": true and gives a pattern for value. Then value is
// matched as a regular expression, counts still bound the matches per file, and
// every matched substring across all the declared files must be byte-identical —
// so the guard catches drift without pinning (and re-pinning) the current value.
//
// An entry whose watched files are all the same import-capable technology (all
// JS/TS) is a misuse, not drift: those files CAN share an import, so the value
// should live in one module and be imported — not copied and byte-counted. The
// guard flags such an entry so the redundancy is fixed at the source.
