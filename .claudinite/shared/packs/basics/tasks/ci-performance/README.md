# ci-performance

## Why the declaration reads as it does

Carried over from the declaration's comments when it became `task.json`.

basics task: ci-performance — the weekly read on where this repo's CI time goes,
and whether it has got worse.

A suite's runtime degrades the way a lawn grows: never in one visible step, so
nobody profiles it until it is bad enough to complain about, by which point the
cause is a dozen changes back. This task takes the measurement on a cadence
instead, from the one ledger that cannot be argued with — the Actions run
history — and keeps a standing record of it.

CONDITIONAL HANDOFF. Code-work does the measuring, which is pure code: read the
runs, take each workflow's median over this window and the one before, compare.
A quiet week ends there — the record is refreshed and no agent is spent. Only a
real regression requests the agent, which then has something worth its time: a
named workflow, a before and after, and the ci-performance-evaluation skill's
method for finding the cause.

WHY sonnet: the finding arrives already localized to a workflow and a delta, and
the skill states the method step by step; what remains is profiling and a bounded
fix. Ceilinged at `pr`; what it may land unattended is the `automerge` policy below.

Movement, not standing state: CI runtime only changes when something lands, so
a week where nothing moved has the same runs, the same medians and the same
verdict as last week.
A couple of hundred run records plus one job breakdown, against this repo's own
API. Seconds in practice; the bound is for a rate-limited or wedged read.
Profiling a suite means running it, more than once, in both arms of an A/B.
