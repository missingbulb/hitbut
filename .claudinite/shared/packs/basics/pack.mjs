// Its skills/ holds general engineering practice every project's work can call for,
// whatever its technology, mounted wherever basics is declared (which --init seeds
// everywhere). When one stops being a baseline activity, its directory moves to the
// pack whose projects need it (#385 moved the git/GitHub and Claudinite-lifecycle
