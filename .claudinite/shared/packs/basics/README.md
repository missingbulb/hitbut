# basics pack

The baseline pack — the `RULES.md` prose every session loads (injected by the pack-prose hook) plus the working-discipline checks. Its subject is **how work is done**, whatever tool is running it. Declared explicitly like every other pack — no pack is active by default; bootstrap seeds the declaration and the nightly baselining backfills it into existing consumers.

Two rules are skills the guard forces for the files they concern: writing a check that scans the
repo ([`writing-repo-scanning-checks`](skills/writing-repo-scanning-checks/SKILL.md), for any coded
or declared check) and editing a `GENERATED` file
([`working-with-generated-files`](skills/working-with-generated-files/SKILL.md)).

## Checks

The working-discipline rules with a deterministic signature. The world rules read repo state; the four work rules judge the change and the session in front of you.

| Check | Severity | Reason | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `markdown-link-labels` | low | complexity | check: blocking |
| `declared-check-messages` | medium | complexity | check: blocking |

| `file-placement` | medium | complexity | check: advisory |
| `shared-constants` | high | correctness | check: blocking |
| `warning-suppression` | medium | complexity | check: blocking |
| `rules-line-length` | low | complexity | check: advisory |

`barrier` is the one check a project has to configure before it does anything: it enforces a
**directed folder-access graph** the repo declares on this pack's entry as `config.barriers.rules`,
and a repo that declares none is silent rather than failing. [barriers.md](barriers.md) is the whole
vocabulary — the rule forms, how a reference is resolved against the tree, the exception kinds, and
how another pack ships a fixed barrier of its own as manifest data. It arrived here when the
`barriers` pack was absorbed (#1681): no project ever chose that pack, it rode in on the baseline's
`requires` closure, and a separate identity for a mechanism everyone already has bought only a
second catalog row and an adoption question nobody had asked for.
