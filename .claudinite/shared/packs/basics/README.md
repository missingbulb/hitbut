# basics pack

The baseline pack — the `RULES.md` prose every session loads (injected by the pack-prose hook) plus the working-discipline checks. Its subject is **how work is done**, whatever tool is running it. Declared explicitly like every other pack — no pack is active by default; bootstrap seeds the declaration and the nightly baselining backfills it into existing consumers.

## Checks

The working-discipline rules with a deterministic signature. The world rules read repo state; the four work rules judge the change and the session in front of you.

| Check | Severity | Reason | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `markdown-link-labels` | low | complexity | check: blocking |
| `declared-check-messages` | medium | complexity | check: blocking |
| `declared-check-spec-keys` | medium | correctness | check: advisory |
| `file-placement` | medium | complexity | check: advisory |
| `shared-constants` | high | correctness | check: blocking |
| `warning-suppression` | medium | complexity | check: blocking |
| `rules-line-length` | low | complexity | check: advisory |
| `claude-md-length` | medium | performance | check: advisory |
| `generated-merge-driver` | medium | correctness | check: advisory |
| `catalog-completeness` | medium | complexity | check: blocking |
| `reference-integrity` | medium | correctness | check: blocking |
| `runnable-doc-commands` | high | correctness | check: blocking |
| `task-lifecycle` | medium | complexity | check: blocking |
| `squash-merge-history` | high | correctness | check: blocking |
