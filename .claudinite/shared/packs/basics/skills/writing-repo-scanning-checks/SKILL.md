# Writing a check that scans the repo

- **Choosing the file set** — take it from `git ls-files` rather than a filesystem walk with
  paths to skip, and remember a brand-new file is untracked until you add it, so a green run
  isn't coverage of it.

- **Scanning for a forbidden token** — strip comments first so it matches code, not prose —
  string-aware, since a `//` inside a URL is not a comment. Reuse `stripComments` from
  [`engine/checks/helpers/code-scanning.mjs`](../../../../engine/checks/helpers/code-scanning.mjs);
  if the scan can't import it, inline the same pass and point a comment back at that source.
  Strip in **both** directions — a comment that documents or warns about the banned pattern is
  exactly where a naive check trips over its own reasoning, so a commented-out instance must not
  count as present either.

- **Proving the check silent** — run it against the repo's own **real** sources, not only a
  synthetic clean fixture — a fixture spelling the same gap the check has just keeps proving the
  matching, and only a real-tree run can disagree with you.
