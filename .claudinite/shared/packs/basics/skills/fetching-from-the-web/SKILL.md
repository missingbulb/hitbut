# Fetching from the web

- **Needing exact text** — a summarizing fetch tool is not a source; when the bytes matter, `curl`
  into the scratchpad and read from disk.
- **A `403`** — don't retry and don't try a sibling URL; attribute the search snippet to the
  publisher instead of asserting it, and mark it for re-verification.
- **A sandbox or proxy denial is a policy boundary, not an obstacle to route around** — no
  open-network runner, no ad-hoc CI workflow, no push-triggered probe to make the request from
  somewhere the policy does not apply. Answer from committed reference material or ask the owner,
  and say plainly that anything unverifiable is unverified.
- **An explicit egress block** (`EGRESS_BLOCKED`) is domain-wide, unlike a publisher's `403`:
  working down alternate sources for the same fact spends the same denial on each. Never file the
  gap as "re-verify next pass" — no later agent pass can cross a policy block either; mark it as
  needing a human or an unblocked environment.
