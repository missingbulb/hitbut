// The other half of the task contract (the writing-tasks skill, "Every task
// declaration carries the full contract" + "The task folder"): the declaration
// and the folder it sits in must AGREE. `task-declaration-shape` asserts the
// declaration's own shape — that `id` and `agent_instructions` are present and
// the enums are legal — and stops at the file's edge; this rule is the
// cross-artifact invariant between that file and the tree around it.
//
// Why it is its own rule rather than more of that one: both faces fail the same
// way, and it is the way a shape error does NOT fail. Discovery
// (packs/claudinite-tasks/discover.mjs) is fail-soft per task — a task whose declared
// `id` differs from its directory name is dropped into `errors` and simply never
// runs, and a dangling `agent_instructions` hands the executor a worker doc that
// isn't there. Nothing goes red; the scheduler keeps reporting healthy runs while
// the task is silently absent from every one of them. That is the class this
// repo's own canon names as the expensive one, so it is worth catching where it
// is cheap: at author time, in the session that wrote the file.
//
// RELEVANCE FIRST (engine/checks/README.md): gated on a `tasks/<name>/task.mjs`
// existing, so the rule is inert on any repo that schedules nothing. Static text
// over the self-contained module (task.mjs imports nothing), the same parse the
// shape rule uses, so the two views of one file can't disagree.
