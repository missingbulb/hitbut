// claudinite-growth task: growth-discover-packs — LOCAL pack discovery, per repo
// (per-project-scheduling redesign). Each repo periodically reflects on its OWN
// stack and captured knowledge: knowing the canon packs already available to it, if
// it notices project-specific knowledge worth organizing into a new LOCAL pack — a
// segment of the repo's own tree whose work no canon pack homes and its existing local
// packs don't yet capture; never a technology or methodology pack, which is the
// canon-side promote stage's call — it authors that local pack. A per-repo, local operation: it
// writes only the repo's OWN `.claudinite/local/packs/` (the shared canon stays
// human-gated — lifting a local pack up is the central promote task's job).
//
// Reviewed, NOT auto-merged, unlike growth-extract. Extract adds prose or a rule to
// territory a local pack already owns; a NEW pack ships new `.mjs` conformance checks
// that run at every Stop and in CI from the moment it merges, so a wrong or over-eager
// one breaks the repo with nobody having looked. Same reason the sibling
// prose-to-checks-sweep declares open-pr — a check can break CI, so it's reviewed.
// expected_outcome is a hard ceiling the executor enforces (verify-outcome.mjs), so
// this declaration is what actually keeps auto-merge off the PR.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.
