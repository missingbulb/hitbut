// The growth-dedup CODE-WORK: detect what the mounted canon changed in the window,
// and write the brief the agentic phase starts from.
//
// A run woken by canon movement used to be told only WHICH declared packs moved.
// A pack is a corpus, so that sent the run re-reading all of it for coverage that
// mostly predates the window, while the thing that can NEWLY cover a local item —
// what the canon ADDED in those days — was nowhere in the dispatch. Detecting it
// is deterministic code over the commit records, which is code-work's half of the
// task, not the agent's.
//
// Two kinds of addition, and the second is why a prose-only read is not enough: a
// canon **check** enforces its rule on every session and CI pass, which covers a
// local item more strongly than a stated line does, and it is invisible in the
// prose corpus. The brief carries both.
//
// The channel is the REPOSITORY, per the code-work contract (task-code-work DESIGN
// §3): no code→agent data channel exists, so the brief is posted as a COMMENT on
// the run's own work item, whose number code-work is handed as CLAUDINITE_ITEM.
// The item is where the agentic phase is already reading, the brief describes THIS
// window and nothing else, and both die together when the item converges — which
// is the whole life the brief has. A standing issue would outlive it by a week and
// then hold a stale window.
