// claudinite-growth task: logs-prune — retention on the `conversation-logs`
// branch. `agent_model: 'none'` with `code_work: 'node worker.mjs'`: the whole pass
// is deterministic code the scheduler runs as a subprocess — no agent, no dispatch
// issue, seconds of runtime. The same shape usage-fold already has over the same
// branch.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT PART OF growth-extract. Deleting a capture past retention is
// arithmetic on dates over an orphan branch — which is why the extract worker had
// to spend prose forbidding an agent to merge that branch or rewrite its history.
// Coupled to the opus run it also kept that run's precondition carrying a second
// arm whose only job was to fire the prune on a quiet repo, so a repo with nothing
// to extract still paid an opus dispatch on the nights one log aged out.
//
// WHAT MAKES AGE ENOUGH. The prune used to be coupled to a judgment step — an aged
// log got a final pass before deletion — so pruning on the calendar risked deleting
// a capture nothing had read. What removes the risk is the extract run's READING
// WINDOW, not a per-file handshake between the two tasks: growth-extract reads from
// the oldest end of the branch on every run, against a retention measured in days,
// so a capture reaches retention having been read. The extract-from-conversations
// skill owns that window; this task owns the arithmetic.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.
