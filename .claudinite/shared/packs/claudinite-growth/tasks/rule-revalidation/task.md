# Rule revalidation — re-probe the claims whose truth lives outside this repo

Most of a pack's prose is judgment: how to approach a change, what to do first, what never to do. Judgment does not expire. A smaller set of rules is different — each one asserts a **fact about the environment**: that the harness accepts a call in a certain shape, that the Action's token can or cannot reach a path, that an MCP tool exists, that a platform behaves a particular way. Those were true on the day they were written and are true today only by luck, because nothing in this repo turns red when a platform moves under them. The prose stays green, sessions keep obeying it, and the cost arrives as a session spent on a route that closed.

This task re-runs the probe behind each such claim, weekly, and corrects what no longer holds.

The run's **Context section is binding scope**: it names the **pack paths** to revalidate and the two probe rules below. Work those paths — a consuming repo's own local packs by default; Claudinite also its core `packs/`. A canon pack a repo only mounts is revalidated in the repo that owns it, on this same task.

Open a PR and leave it for review. This task rewrites the rules sessions obey, on evidence a reviewer cannot re-derive from the diff, so every run's changes go in front of the owner.

## What counts as a revalidatable claim

A sentence in a rule, a check's `failureMessage` or `fix` text, or a skill's procedure, that would be **falsified by a change nobody in this repo makes**. The three richest seams:

- **The Claude environment** — tool contracts and their failure modes (what `Edit` requires before it will apply, what a scheduling call rejects, what a search returns for a bare name), which harness surfaces exist, what a session can and cannot see.
- **GitHub permissions and API behaviour** — what the Action's `GITHUB_TOKEN` may push or label, what a path refuses, which status a call returns, what a repository setting gates.
- **MCP functions** — that a named tool exists, what its parameters are called, what it returns, which server carries it.

Also fair game: any rule naming a version floor, a runtime's behaviour, or an external service's response shape.

**Not** in scope, and left alone without a probe: judgment and taste rules; rules about how *this* repo is organized (a check already guards those, and a stale one fails loudly); product requirements; anything whose truth a reviewer could settle by reading the tree.

## The probe

A claim is revalidated by **executing the smallest thing that would distinguish true from false**, and reporting what actually happened — never by recalling what you know, and never by reasoning from the rule's own wording.

Two rules bound it, both binding scope from the dispatch:

1. **Read-only.** Probe by doing the harmless half: call the tool and read its schema, request the resource, run the command that reports rather than acts. A claim whose probe would **write, delete, merge, publish, notify, or spend a credential** is not probed — verify it against authoritative documentation and say in the log that documentation, not a run, is the evidence.
2. **A probe you cannot run is `unprobed`, not disproven.** This session carries the reach its repo was provisioned with, which is not the reach every rule was written under. A tool that is absent *here*, a permission denied *to this session*, a network path the sandbox blocks — none of that is evidence the claim is stale. Leave the rule exactly as it stands, log it as unprobed, and move on. Rewriting a rule into "you cannot do X" because *this* session could not is the single worst outcome available to this task: it is unfalsifiable afterwards, and it removes a capability from every future session.

## What a run does

1. **Slice.** The corpus is standing and mostly stable, so a run takes a **slice**, not the whole thing: the claims longest since their last recorded probe, per the tracker's log, plus any the log has never covered. Prefer the claims whose staleness would cost most — a rule that would send a session down a dead path beats a version number in a comment. Ten well-probed claims beat forty skimmed.
2. **Probe each**, per the rules above, and record what you ran and what came back.
3. **Correct what is stale**, as far as the probe reaches and no further — one probe answers one claim, and a neighbouring claim it seems to imply gets its own probe. Rewrite the rule to what the probe showed, in the same voice and at the same length, and carry the *new* fact — not a note about the correction, and not a dated changelog. Where the claim was a check's premise rather than prose, and the check itself is now asserting a dead fact, fix the check and its fixture. Where a claim has become simply irrelevant (the surface it describes is gone), delete the rule whole rather than trimming it toward nothing.
4. **Open a PR** — one per run, on a per-run-unique branch, its commit referencing the tracking issue so the `task-lifecycle` gate passes. The PR body is the evidence a reviewer cannot re-derive: per changed rule, the probe run and its result. Keep the repo's offline test suite green.
5. **Log to the tracker.** The standing log is the issue titled exactly **`Claudinite tracker: Rule Revalidation`** in this repo. Find it **by that exact title, never a fuzzy match or a hard-coded number**; create it already closed if missing — creation always lands an issue open and ignores a `state: closed` argument, so create it and close it in a second call. **Never open, close, or reopen it** afterward. Log each run as a dated comment listing every claim probed with its verdict — `holds`, `stale (corrected)`, `unprobed (why)`, or `doc-verified` — because that list is what the *next* run slices against. A run that found everything still true logs exactly that.
