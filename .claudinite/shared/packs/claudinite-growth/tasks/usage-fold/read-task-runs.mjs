// The usage fold's SECOND source, and a HISTORICAL one: the retired slot scheduler's
// own Actions runs (skill-usage-metrics DESIGN §4.2). Each of its runs printed one
// machine-readable record per due task saying what it did with it — dispatched an
// agent, ran it as code-work only, skipped it on its precondition, failed it, or
// deferred it. This module reads those records back out of the run logs.
//
// NOTHING WRITES THEM ANY MORE (#974). The reader stays because the logs it reads are
// still inside Actions retention and are still real; when they age out it returns
// nothing, which is the correct answer rather than a fault. The queue keeps each
// occurrence's outcome as a label on its own work item instead — a better record and
// a different read, tracked as #994.
//
// It lives in this task's folder because nothing else uses it, and it holds no
// counting logic: it turns "runs since the watermark" into `[{ date, pack, task,
// outcome }]`, and fold-usage.mjs does the arithmetic.
//
// FORWARD-ONLY, past a watermark — unlike the capture files, which the fold
// re-reads from scratch every night. The reason is the source, not the taste: the
// logs branch is local git (one tree read plus one blob read, no budget to spend),
// while these are paged REST reads over a rate-limited API, two calls per run, and
// re-reading a 10-day window every night would cost ~20x the calls for an identical
// answer. So each fold reads only what is new and the aggregate carries how far it
// got. The cost is stated where the trade is made (fold-usage.mjs `foldTaskRuns`):
// a counting bug fixed later applies from the fix forward, it does not heal history.
//
// FAIL-SOFT. Every failure here — an unreadable ledger, a log that 404s, a run whose
// jobs cannot be listed — degrades this ONE source to "nothing new this run" and
// leaves the watermark where it was, so the next fold retries the same runs. The
// skill and check counts do not depend on it and must not be lost with it.
