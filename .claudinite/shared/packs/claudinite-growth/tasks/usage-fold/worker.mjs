// The usage-fold code-work entry point — the script the executor runs as code-work,
// `node worker.mjs` (cwd = this task dir, bounded by code_work_timeout).
// The whole task: no agent phase.
//
// It holds NO counting logic. The counting and folding are `fold-usage.mjs`, its
// SIBLING in this task folder — nothing outside this task uses them, so that is
// where they live and where their tests point. This file is the I/O shell:
//
//   1. fetch the orphan `conversation-logs` branch (plain local git — the branch is
//      in this repo, so one tree read plus one blob read per file beats any REST
//      round-trip, and there is no rate budget to spend);
//   2. count each capture file still in the raw retention window;
//   3. read the scheduler's own task-run records from its Actions logs, past the
//      `runsFoldedThrough` watermark (read-task-runs.mjs) — the second source, and
//      the only one that sees a task that never opened a session at all;
//   4. fold: day rows recomputed from scratch, task rows appended once, week rows
//      advanced past the `foldedThrough` watermark (skill-usage-metrics DESIGN §5);
//   5. deliver the regenerated `.claudinite/local/usage.GENERATED.json` on a PR
//      that lands itself where this repo's delivery settings allow (the shared
//      landing helper owns those nuances — engine/scheduler/land-pr.mjs) — and
//      open NOTHING when the recompute is byte-identical.
//
// The aggregate lives under `.claudinite/local/` because that is the repo-owned area
// the vendoring refresh never touches; the mount root itself is read-only canon.
