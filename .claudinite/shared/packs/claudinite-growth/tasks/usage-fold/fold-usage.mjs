// The usage FOLD's counting and folding core (skill-usage-metrics DESIGN §4, §5).
// Every function here is pure and individually tested; worker.mjs is the I/O shell
// that reads the logs branch, calls these, and delivers the result.
//
// The questions this answers, one tested function each:
//   - which skills did a captured session LOAD, and how often;
//   - what workload was that against (captures, merges, sessions, user messages,
//     user commands) — the denominators without which a raw load count cannot
//     distinguish healthy-rare from broken;
//   - what the SCHEDULER did with each task — agent runs, deterministic
//     preprocessing-only runs, precondition skips, failures, deferrals. That last
//     family comes from the scheduler's own run records rather than from a captured
//     session, which is why it is a census of scheduled work where everything else
//     here is a sample of captured sessions.
//
// Zeros are implicit throughout: a mounted skill with no loads simply has no key.
// The zero set is derived by the consumer, diffing against the repo's mounted
// skills — which is exactly what makes "this skill never loads" visible at all.

// The non-builtin imports are both the engine surface a pack may build on
// (pack-independence). "Which skills does this repo mount" has exactly one home —
// the pack registry — and asking it here is what keeps the fold's answer identical
// to what the SessionStart hook actually mounted. The task-run outcome vocabulary
// has exactly one home too: the scheduler that prints those records, so the counter
// keys here cannot drift from the words the runs actually emit.

// --- entry classification -----------------------------------------------------
// Every shape below was verified against real captured transcripts on a
// conversation-logs branch, not inferred from the harness docs.

// A genuine human turn. POSITIVE test, deliberately: the transcript stamps a
// typed-by-a-person turn with `origin: { kind: 'human' }`, and everything else a
// user-role entry can be — a tool result, an injected/meta turn, a subagent's
// sidechain traffic, a compaction summary, a slash-command expansion, and (the one
// that matters most here) a scheduled-task firing, which carries
// `origin: { kind: 'task-notification', subkind: 'scheduled-trigger' }` — simply
// lacks that stamp. Testing FOR the human marker rather than against a list of
// automated ones means a new automated entry shape is excluded the day it appears
// instead of silently inflating the denominator.
//
// The honest boundary: an older harness wrote no `origin` at all. Those turns count
// as non-human, so a repo's very old captures under-report userMessages rather than
// over-reporting them. This is the most fragile line in the fold, which is why it is
// one function with a fixture per shape it excludes.

// --- check activations ---------------------------------------------------------
// The conformance checks are the other half of the picture, and the more valuable
// half: a check that FAILS is a win — the finding lands back in the session and the
// agent corrects before the work leaves. So the questions here are "how often did
// each scope actually run" and "how often did it catch something", and the second
// one is the one that matters.
//
// Neither runner writes a metrics file, so both are read off the marks they already
// leave in the transcript. There are exactly three, and each was verified against
// real captured logs:
//
//   1. The Stop hook's `hooklog` line — `<iso> run=<id> Stop: done exit=<n> <reason>`
//      — reaches the transcript because hooklog mirrors to stderr and the harness
//      records hook stderr. This is the ONLY mark that survives a PASSING run, which
//      is what makes work-scope run counts (not just failure counts) possible at all.
//   2. `report-findings`' summary line — `N blocking, M advisory (<scope> scope: …)`
//      — names its own scope and survives the `| tail` an agent usually pipes
//      through. It is printed ONLY when there were findings, so it counts failures
//      and finding volume, never runs.
//   3. The runner's own invocation in a Bash command (`node …/check_the_world.mjs`),
//      which is how the world scope runs — its Stop-hook sibling does not exist,
//      because the world sweep is wired into the test/CI flow, not the hook.
//
// CI COUNTS WHEN THE AGENT WAS IN THE LOOP ON IT. The write-commit-watch-CI-fix-it
// cycle is the same correction loop as the Stop hook's, one turn wider, so a CI
// check failure the session acted on is as much a win as a hook one. It is counted
// exactly when the session PULLED THE JOB LOG IN — which is what "the agent was in
// the loop" means operationally. A nightly or post-merge run nobody looked at stays
// uncounted, correctly: nothing was corrected. Those logs come through a CI-log tool
// rather than Bash, and their lines carry the Actions timestamp prefix, so both are
// read below.
//
// STATED BOUNDARY: this counts what the SESSION saw. A sweep whose CI log nobody
// fetched is invisible here, and so is a hook killed before it logged. A CI run is
// also only visible when it PRINTED something — a green sweep prints nothing at all
// — so `ciRuns`/`ciFailures` record the CI share separately, and a consumer wanting
// a clean session-only rate subtracts them. Every number below is a floor on
// activations, never an over-count, which is the direction that keeps "the checks
// caught N things" honest.

// The Stop hook's completion line. `reason` distinguishes the three outcomes the
// hook itself declares: `checks-passed`, `blocking-findings`, `loop-guard-relent`
// (blocking findings that survived two fix attempts — a failure that prints no
// findings block, so it must be read from here), and `runner-error` (the checks did
// not run at all, which is an anti-win masquerading as a quiet day).
