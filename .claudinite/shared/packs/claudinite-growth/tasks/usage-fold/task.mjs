// claudinite-growth task: usage-fold — the per-repo skill-usage aggregate
// (skill-usage-metrics DESIGN §5). `agent_model: 'none'` with
// `code_work: 'node worker.mjs'`: the whole pass is deterministic code the
// executor runs as code-work — no agent phase, seconds of runtime.
//
// WHY: a skill is MOUNTED per repo, but mounting only puts a name and a one-line
// description into the session prompt — actually LOADING it is model discretion, and
// nothing recorded whether it ever happened. The only evidence is the session
// transcript, which is ephemeral and dies at retention on the logs branch. So the
// promotion ladder's skill-vs-prose call had no empirical feedback: a skill whose
// trigger never fires looked exactly like one that fires daily. This task counts
// loads — and the DENOMINATORS that make a count mean something — out of the logs
// this repo already captures, into a small tracked aggregate.
//
// It also counts what the SCHEDULER did: per task, how many runs dispatched an agent,
// how many were deterministic preprocessing only, how many its precondition skipped,
// how many failed, how many were deferred. Those come from the scheduler's own run
// records in its Actions logs — a census of scheduled work, beside the sample of
// captured sessions everything else here is drawn from.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing): the whole contract is this default export.
