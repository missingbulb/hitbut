// A routine (or a per-project-scheduling task, §1) is a folder whose entry point is
// `routine.md` OR `task.md`, alongside the deterministic scripts it invokes. This
// check asserts the prose↔script wiring that the unattended-agents skill mandates,
// for both shapes: a legacy `dev/routines/<name>/routine.md` and a converted
// `.../tasks/<name>/task.md` earn the same guard (a task folder's `task.mjs`
// carries the declaration; its `task.md` is the worker prose the scripts hang off).
//
// RELEVANCE FIRST (see engine/checks/README.md "Adding a rule"): a skill check has no
// declaration gate — the engine runs it on EVERY repo, including ones with no
// routines — so `run` must detect relevance before asserting anything. Here the
// signal is a `routine.md`/`task.md` existing: `routineDirs` is empty on any repo
// without one, every loop below is over an empty set, and the check no-ops. Keep
// that gate narrow and up front; a broad signal would fire false findings everywhere.
