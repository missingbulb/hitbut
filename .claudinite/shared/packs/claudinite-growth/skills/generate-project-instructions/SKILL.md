description: Decompose a project into its pack facets (working-style class, technology, aspect, domain) and extract its working instructions into reusable canon packs plus the project's own local packs (.claudinite/local_packs/). Use when a project has no established working style yet, or it exhibits a facet no pack covers — during bootstrap of a fresh/empty repo, or on an uplevel request.

# Generate project instructions — extract packs, not a project doc

This skill grows the corpus's pack library using the project in front of you as the evidence, and
lands the project's own working rules where every project's do now: its **local packs**. The owner's
projects recur — not as wholes, but **along axes**: the same working style returns with a different
product, the same technology returns with a different working style, the same audience returns on a
different stack. The first project to exhibit a facet pays the cost of working out how that facet is
handled; a **canon** pack is how every later project sharing it starts from the answer instead of
re-deriving it — and what stays specific to *this* project lands in **its own local pack**, the same
pack machinery run from the project's tree.

The deliverable is therefore **two kinds of pack**, never a single "how to work on this repo" document:

- **Canon pack seeds and refinements** — one `packs/<facet>/` per facet where this project has real
  portable insight, each written as if this project didn't exist, proposed to Claudinite.
- **The project's own local pack(s)** — under `.claudinite/local_packs/<pack>/` in the project's tree:
  the project-specific working style, concrete values (real commands, paths, names, metrics), and the
  project-specific rules that *don't* generalize — carried the same way any pack carries them (a check
  in the pack's `rules`, an activity skill, prose in `RULES.md`, a scheduled task), not a thin doc.
  This is the project's normalized capture surface; its `CLAUDE.md` is a thin routing map to it, loaded
  through the pack system rather than `@import`.

The failure mode this skill exists to prevent: investigating the repo and producing one competent "how
to work on this repo" document — real commands, real paths, this product's concepts — with the
reusable core never separated out and the project-specific core dumped as always-loaded prose. If
portable guidance ends up in a local pack (it should be a canon pack), or the project's file names end
up in a canon pack (they belong in the local pack), the split is wrong.

## 1. Gather the evidence

Read the project before writing a word: README and existing docs, `CLAUDE.md` and everything it
imports, dependency and build manifests, scripts and CI, the test layout, git history and recent
PRs/issues, and any conversation with the owner about how they want to work. You are collecting two
things, both grounded in what you actually find:

- the **facets** this project exhibits (step 2), and
- every **candidate rule** — each convention, procedure, or quality bar the project works by — ready to
  be sorted by owner (step 3).

Invent nothing. If a call that changes the outcome is genuinely open, ask the owner one focused
question (via the structured popup); otherwise take the sensible default and note it.

## 2. Decompose into facets, and check the shelf per facet

A project is a bundle of **facets**, each a candidate pack on its own axis:

- **Class — the working style.** How work runs end to end: the loop by which a change is proposed,
  verified, and shipped; the production bar; audience and longevity. Test: the pack still fits a
  project on a different stack, for a different product idea.
- **Technology — the platform.** True for any project on that platform, whatever its class or product.
  Test: the pack still fits when the product and the working style change. The first project on a new
  platform mints its pack — an iPhone app arriving tomorrow mints `iphone-app` the same way
  `chrome-extension` and `aws-sam` were minted.
- **Aspect — a separable slice of concern**, usually with its own on-switch. `chrome-extension-release`
  is the same technology as `chrome-extension` at a different moment: the release/store standard a
  project declares only once it ships. Split an aspect out of its parent facet when its rules activate
  at a different time or under a different decision than the parent's.
- **Domain — the audience or setting**, when it changes how work is done. A children's-app pack would
  carry design-review, requirement-processing, and compliance rules that hold whether the app is
  Flutter or web; a regulated-industry pack likewise. A domain that doesn't change the working rules
  isn't a facet worth a pack.

**The product itself is never a facet** — "this specific product" doesn't recur, by definition; its
rules land in the project's own local pack.

And a *statement of what the product does* isn't a pack rule at all — not even a local one. A pack, canon
or local, homes **how we work**: the conventions, gotchas and review discipline that recur across tasks
whatever the feature happens to be. The working-discipline rules bar the requirement-shaped rule outright;
here, catch it wearing a convention's clothes — a rule asserting which entities exist, what a surface must
render, or that a feature's parts are wired to each other. Pack-worthiness
is a question about the *work*, not about how load-bearing the code is — a real gap in product coverage is a
requirements gap, and answering it with a pack is how a feature's spec ends up somewhere nothing executes it.

<example>
One extension project can exhibit four facets at once: `spec-driven-product` (class),
`chrome-extension` + `node` (technologies), `chrome-extension-release` (aspect, once it ships) — and
its local pack holds only what none of them own.
</example>

Then check the canon shelf **per facet** (`packs/` here; the mounted `.claudinite/packs/` in a
consuming repo — a facet already owned by a *canon* pack is declared, not re-authored locally):

- **Covered** → declare it (technology facets are usually already declared from the fingerprint) and
  move on — unless this project's evidence **sharpens or contradicts** the pack, which becomes a
  refinement PR to that pack, not a fork. Each further project of a facet is another exemplar: the
  pack should read as the intersection-plus-union of all of them, and a rule only one exemplar
  supports should say so or wait.
- **Uncovered, with real portable insight in the evidence** → this skill mints it (steps 3–4).
- **Uncovered, but this project has nothing durable to say about it yet** → leave it; a pack of
  placeholders helps nobody.

Write each facet down — a short name plus one defining sentence — before drafting anything; every
sorting decision in step 3 tests against them.

## 3. Sort every candidate rule to the single facet that owns it

For each rule from step 1, apply the **portability strip per facet**: delete from the rule everything
the facet doesn't keep, and see whether something meaningful survives.

- Delete the product and the stack, keep the loop — survives? → the **class** pack (canon).
- Delete the product and the working style, keep the platform — survives? → the **technology** (or
  **aspect**) pack (canon).
- Delete the stack, keep the audience/setting — survives? → the **domain** pack (canon).
- Survives nothing → project-specific: the project's **own local pack**.

Route each rule to **exactly one owner** — the facet whose whole population the rule serves. "True for
any Node service" belongs to the canon `node` pack, not to this project's class pack, even if every
project of the class happens to use Node. Rewrite what lands in a canon pack project-agnostically and
parameterized, the way research-project does ("read *input* as whatever it means for your project").

Then gate **every** pack-bound rule — canon or local — on the promotion ladder
([engine/checks/DESIGN.md](../../../../engine/checks/DESIGN.md)): a rule a deterministic **check** could enforce, or a
procedure with a nameable trigger a **skill** could carry, becomes that (in a canon seed it's flagged
as a check/skill candidate; in a local pack you author the check outright in the pack's `rules`, with
a red-first fixture) rather than settling as prose. What remains in a `RULES.md` is the always-relevant
judgment core of its facet — write more checks and less prose. Dedupe against the corpus: a rule the
basics baseline, an existing canon pack, or a skill already owns is not pack material at all.

## 4. Write each pack

Mint a pack for a facet only when its surviving rules clear the bar — several durable rules, not one
stray (a single rule joins the nearest existing pack, or waits as a handoff note). Each
`packs/<facet>/` needs four things (mirror `research-project/` and `chrome-extension/`):

- **`RULES.md`** — the playbook, addressed to the *next* project sharing the facet, on day one. Open
  with the facet's one-line definition and "a default to adapt, not a contract". Principle-first, each
  rule carrying its why. It loads at session start for every declaring project, so every line pays
  rent — cover the facet, not everything you noticed.
- **`pack.mjs`** — the manifest. Class/domain/aspect packs: `always: false`, `marker: null`,
  `detect: null` (declaration is authoritative). Technology packs: add the `marker`/`detect`
  fingerprint when the repo carries a reliable one, so `--init` seeds the pack into a fresh
  declaration; the marker only *suspects* a pack is wanted, it never forces its declaration.
  Discovery is structural — the directory is the registration.
- **`README.md`** — the pack's rule table (section ≤5 words | how enforced), plus one provenance line
  naming the project it was distilled from.
- **Index entries** — a row in [packs/README.md](../../../../packs/README.md) and, for a new pack kind, the
  matching line in the corpus map ([README.md](../../../../README.md) — there is no agent-facing corpus index, #385).

The acid test before proposing any pack: **a reader must not be able to tell which project it was
extracted from.** Any surviving repo path, command line, or product noun marks a rule that belonged in
the overlay.

## 5. Write the project's own local pack(s)

The project-specific residue lands in a **local pack** under `.claudinite/local_packs/<pack>/` in the
project's tree — the same pack machinery, run from the project instead of the canon. Most projects
need **one** general pack (name it for the project); segregate a **second** only along the repo's own
**project structure** — a segment of the repo's tree whose work is its own territory (a `client` pack
for work under `client/`) — never around a technology or a methodology: those axes belong to the canon
(their portable half is a canon seed above; the project-specific residue lands in the structural pack
that owns the work). Each local pack is a real pack:

- **`pack.mjs`** — `{ id, detect: null, marker: null, prose: 'RULES.md', rules: [...], skills: [...] }`.
  A local pack is declared by hand, never fingerprinted or seeded (`detect`/`marker` stay null), as its
  namespaced token `local_packs/<name>` in `.claudinite-checks.json`; its id
  must be unique and may not shadow a canon pack.
- **`RULES.md`** — the always-loaded judgment core and the project's concrete values (real
  setup/run/verify commands, real paths, inputs, metrics, invariants). Keep it terse; anything a check
  or skill can carry doesn't belong here, and anything inferable from the code is omitted.
- **Checks** (`rules`) — the project-specific deterministic rules as `.mjs` modules listed on
  `pack.mjs`, each with a red-first fixture (`pack.test.mjs`) runnable by the project's own test suite.
  Local check modules stay dependency-free (they must load without the gitignored mount): return plain
  finding objects rather than importing the engine's helpers.
- **Skills** (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) — the project's activity-scoped procedures, bundled in the pack;
  a local pack may also *require* a canon skill by name.
- **Scheduled tasks** (`tasks/<name>/task.mjs` + its `task.md`) — first-class like every other kind of
  pack content: the repo's own scheduler discovers a local pack's tasks in the same scan that finds a canon pack's,
  gated by the project's declaration exactly the same way. So project-specific scheduled work belongs
  in a local task declaration (a self-contained module honoring the task contract, with its
  co-located worker doc), not an out-of-repo routine and not a cron of its own.

The project's `CLAUDE.md` becomes a thin **routing map** to its local packs (and its genuine design
docs) — it does **not** `@import` the pack prose; the pack system injects the active local packs'
`RULES.md` at session start, the same as the canon packs'.

## 6. Deliver through the owner's approval gates

- **Every canon pack seed or refinement → a PR against Claudinite.** Minting or changing a *canon* pack
  is the owner's call, and the PR is that gate — no corpus change lands unattended
  ([the canon-curation README](../../../../.claudinite/local/packs/canon-curation/README.md)). From a consuming repo, never edit the read-only
  `.claudinite/` mount: open the Claudinite PR when the session can reach that repo; otherwise stage the
  seed as a **local pack** clearly marked as a proposed-canon facet and open a Claudinite issue pointing
  at it, so the promote stage lifts it centrally.
- **The project's local pack(s) → the project's normal branch/PR**, committed under
  `.claudinite/local_packs/` (tracked project content — the sync hook preserves it, the gitignore
  re-includes it). Declaring a **local** pack — as `local_packs/<name>` — is valid immediately (the
  engine discovers local packs from the repo), so the declaration lands in the same PR.
- **Declare a new *canon* pack** in `.claudinite-checks.json` only after it has merged and the mount
  re-synced — declaring a canon id the mounted registry doesn't know is an unknown-pack settings error;
  a *local* id is never that error. Note a pending canon declaration as a follow-up in the project PR.
- **Existing projects sharing a facet keep their local packs for now.** Once the canon pack lands, the
  growth dedup stage prunes what the canon newly owns; don't pre-trim against an unmerged pack.

Close with a short report: each facet and its one-line definition, with its shelf verdict (declared /
refined / minted-to-canon / kept-local / left alone); the sort tally (rules sent to each canon pack /
the local pack / as a check vs. a skill vs. prose); and links to the PRs.
