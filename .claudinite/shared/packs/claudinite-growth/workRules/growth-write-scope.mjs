// The write-surface gate for the growth lifecycle's two CAPTURE runs — extract
// and dedup. Their docs bound every edit to the repo's own local packs, and
// extract's PR auto-merges with no human review, so the boundary needs a
// machine guarantee, not a prose request: when a branch carries one of those
// runs' pinned commit subjects, every path it touches — added, modified, or
// deleted — must sit under .claudinite/local/packs/ (the legacy
// .claudinite/local_packs/ accepted during the rename window).
//
// The trigger is the run's whole pinned title, NOT the bare "Claudinite growth:"
// prefix the whole lifecycle shares, because its promote run has a wider surface
// by design: it writes the canon under packs/ and skills/ (its own gate is
// canon-curation's promote-scope.mjs), so keying on the prefix would red it. A
// run whose title this list doesn't carry is simply not this rule's business.
//
// Sibling of that promote-scope gate. Promote can't self-gate — nothing in a
// diff marks it as a promote run, so CI keys on its branch prefix — but a
// capture run marks ITSELF via its title, so this rule self-gates and runs
// everywhere the pack is active: at the session Stop hook (work scope), and as
// a CLI on every PR in the canon repo's CI.
//
// Local packs live under either root during the rename transition; git emits
// '/'-separated paths, so the platform-joined constants are normalized.
