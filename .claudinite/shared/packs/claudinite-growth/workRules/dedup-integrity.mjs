// The machine backstop for the growth-dedup task doc's rule: a dedup edit only ever REMOVES
// portable text. The routine has instead reworded partially-covered items —
// leading with a "this rule is portable (canon)" meta-line and re-stating the
// now-canon rule (and which pack owns it) inside the local pack — which grows
// the entry and duplicates canon prose, the inverse of dedup. Two independent
// signals catch that:
//
//  (1) Canon-restatement fingerprint. An ADDED local-pack prose line that says
//      a rule "is portable (canon)", that a "pack owns" a rule, or that the
//      canon "owns" it, is re-importing the canon into the local pack. This is
//      a corruption on any branch, dedup-labeled or not, so it is unscoped. The
//      legitimate delegation convention ("(canon): here <residue>") names the
//      canon without any of these phrasings, so it is not matched.
//
//  (2) A dedup run must SHRINK the pack it prunes. Scoped to a run whose commits
//      announce a dedup (extract legitimately GROWS a pack, so the shrink
//      invariant can't be unscoped): a modified local-pack prose file whose head
//      has more lines than its base grew instead of pruning.
//
//      A commit message saying "dedup" is not enough on its own — a change that
//      FIXES the dedup routine says "dedup" too, and it edits the canon while
//      touching a local pack, which reads as a corrupt prune. So the shrink
//      invariant also requires the branch to be CONFINED to the local-pack
//      surface, which a real run always is: the routine's own first prohibition
//      is that it never edits the canon it prunes against. A branch reaching
//      outside local packs is canon work that merely mentions dedup.
//
// git emits '/'-separated paths, so the platform-joined constant is normalized.
