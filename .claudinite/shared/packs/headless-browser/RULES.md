# Headless browser

Driving a real browser from your own process — a page loaded, faked, driven and captured by code
rather than by a user. True whether the output is a golden image, a build artifact, or an
assertion about behaviour, and whether the driver is Playwright or Puppeteer.

This pack is the browser itself, and deliberately restates none of the ground either side of it:
**which** engine a UI golden should be rendered with, what tolerance it may carry, and the approval
gate before re-baselining one are testing decisions, and wiring the run into a workflow is a
workflow one.

## Getting a browser

- **Resolve the binary out of the environment; never let the driver download one.** A container
  or runner image that already ships a browser is the normal case, and the driver's own registry
  download is slow, often blocked, and pins a build you did not choose. Look for an explicit
  override variable first, then the image's browser root, then fall through to the driver's own
  resolution — and prefer the driver's `-core` package, which bundles no browser at all. The
  image's build number need not match the driver's own pin for the browser to launch. Never
  hardcode the version-stamped path you found by looking: it moves with the next image, and the
  failure lands on whoever rebuilds rather than on whoever wrote it.

- **A fresh install of the driver package is the same danger from upstream.** Reinstalling the
  package to fix an import error just as easily resolves to a newer release than the one paired
  with the environment's pinned browser — it then hunts for a browser build the image was never
  given and fails asking for a network install the sandbox cannot make. A reinstall run from the
  repo root instead of a scratchpad can dodge that failure outright (a version happens to
  resolve that works) and still cost you: it dirties the tracked `package.json`, its lockfile and
  `node_modules`, which then need a manual revert before anything can be committed. Resolve the
  already-installed package by its global path instead of adding a second copy, at any depth in
  the tree.

- **When a page depends on a third-party library loaded from a CDN you have not vendored,
  stub the library's own API surface rather than trying to make the CDN reachable.** A default
  network abort (above) leaves the page's global for that library undefined, so every call into
  it throws and the render comes back empty — indistinguishable from a product bug unless you
  know the cause. Grep the code under test for the handful of calls it actually makes (a mapping
  or charting library often boils down to a handful of constructors and methods) and install a
  minimal no-op implementation of just those as an init script, before the page's own scripts run.

- **A committed pixel golden is only comparable under the exact build that rendered it.** Two
  browsers a version apart rasterise text and shadows differently, so a comparison across them
  measures the renderer, not the product. Where the output is compared pixel by pixel, read the
  installed driver version at launch and **refuse to run** on any other, naming the pinned one in
  the error; where it is not — a build artifact, a behavioural assertion — let the build float
  and spend nothing on pinning it.

- **Pinning is what buys a zero-diff browser golden — budget for the whole recipe or accept a
  tolerance.** A browser screenshot is not bit-stable across machines by default, which is why
  the general advice is a small tolerance. It *can* be made bit-stable, and the price is this
  pack's next two sections in full: the pinned build, a font jail, and the rasterisation flags.
  Take all of it or take the tolerance; a half-applied recipe gives a zero-diff gate that fails
  on someone else's machine for reasons no one can read off the diff.

## The page's world is an input — replace all of it

- **Serve the page from a fake origin you fulfil from disk, and abort anything you did not
  name.** Intercepting at the browser needs no server process, no port and no free-port race,
  and it reaches *every* request the page makes rather than the ones an application-level mock
  happens to know about. Make the default arm an abort: a new external dependency then breaks
  the run loudly instead of quietly adding real network to a run meant to be hermetic.

- **Use an `https` fake origin.** Geolocation and several other capabilities exist only on a
  secure origin, and a page served over `http` silently takes the denied path instead. Routes
  are fulfilled before any connection is attempted, so no certificate is involved and nothing
  has to be trusted.

- **Route a vendored third-party asset host-agnostically.** A stylesheet you serve in place of a
  CDN copy still resolves *its own* relative URLs against the host it was served from, so the
  font or image files it references arrive addressed to that CDN. Match those follow-up requests
  on the path alone, on any host, or the sheet loads and every asset it names 404s — which
  renders as a silent fallback rather than an error.

- **Know which knobs are fixed at context creation and which are per page.** Locale, timezone,
  viewport, device scale factor, geolocation and permissions belong to the browser *context* and
  cannot be changed once it exists — so proving that a product reads a fixed zone rather than
  the device's takes **two** contexts, not one page reconfigured twice. The clock, seeded
  randomness and injected scripts are per page.

- **A command-line window-size flag is not a viewport — a narrow one does not test the narrow
  layout.** Ask a browser's *CLI* for a phone-sized window and it renders the page at a clamped
  width and crops the overflow, without applying the media queries the width should have
  triggered. The output looks exactly like a horizontal-overflow bug in every section of a page
  that has none, and the instinct is to go hunting through the CSS for the offender. Only a
  context or page created with an explicit viewport puts the page in that layout. Reserve the
  CLI screenshot for the width the window happens to be, and give it a virtual-time budget that
  outlasts the page's entrance animations, or sections capture mid-transition and read as broken
  when they are fine.

- **Install every fake as an init script, so it runs before the page's first script.** A stub
  installed after load has already lost every call made during boot. Seeded randomness, storage
  seeds, and any API you are replacing all belong there.

- **Freezing CSS animation does not freeze the Web Animations API.** Zeroing
  `animation-duration` and `transition-duration` stops declarative animation and nothing else;
  anything driven through `element.animate` keeps running, and a capture races it. Stub the
  method so every such animation resolves on its end state immediately.

- **Give the clock two modes and pick deliberately.** A fixed instant is right for a resting
  state. A requirement about what the *passage* of time changes needs the clock installed and
  paused instead, so the page's timers exist and can be wound forward on purpose — a fixed clock
  has no timers to advance.

## Fonts decide the layout, and the machine decides the fonts

- **Vendoring the web fonts is half the job — every glyph they lack is drawn from the machine.**
  An emoji, an arrow, a currency sign, a non-Latin title: each falls back to whatever the host
  has installed, so the rendering quietly becomes a record of that machine's font set. The
  failure is brutal and unobvious — one string measures wider on a runner than on a workstation,
  wraps, and every card below it moves down a line. Launch the browser with its own
  font-configuration world whose only font directory is one you vendored, with the generic
  families aliased into it, so nothing installed on the host can reach the page.

- **Ask the browser for reproducible rasterisation.** Disable hinting and subpixel text, force
  an sRGB colour profile, hide scrollbars, and disable GPU rasterisation. Shadows and blurs need
  two more: partial raster reuses tiles whose seams land inside a blur, and runtime-optimised
  drawing routines differ by CPU — both make the *same* page render differently run to run on
  one machine.

## Capturing

- **Wait on something the page itself produces, never on the network going quiet.** A selector
  that only exists once data rendered, or text that only appears once an async read returned, is
  a real signal; "no requests for a moment" is a guess that is wrong in both directions. Await
  font readiness too — text laid out before the fonts land is a different image.

- **Clip at an element's box rather than screenshotting the element.** An element screenshot
  scrolls the element into view first, and a scroll dismisses whatever hover or focus opened the
  state you came to capture. A clip moves nothing. For the same reason, open hover-driven UI at
  capture time rather than in a preceding drive step, and settle the scroll position
  deliberately before measuring anything.

- **A bounding box is viewport-space and goes stale.** Drivers scroll an element into view
  before clicking it, so a rectangle measured before a click means somewhere else after one.
  Convert to document coordinates at the moment of measurement, then take the clip from a
  full-page shot so a region below the fold is still inside the rendered image.

- **Round a clip to whole pixels.** A layout rectangle is fractional; letting a fractional clip
  reach the screenshot leaves the rounding to the renderer, and half a pixel either way is a
  different image. Clamp it to the page's own bounds as well — a clip outside the rendered image
  is an error, not a crop.

- **Rendering a shipped page outside its runtime means removing the scripts that need that
  runtime.** They throw on the first missing global and populate nothing, so the capture is of
  an empty surface that looks like a product bug. Strip them after load and set the state you
  meant to show yourself.

- **Launch once and reuse the browser across captures.** Process startup dominates the cost of a
  capture, so a fresh browser per shot turns a fast run into a slow one for nothing; take a new
  context or page per capture instead, and close it, so no state leaks between them.
