# git-github — the git/GitHub domain pack

The git/GitHub side of the task lifecycle, bundled as skills: the advanced procedures
([git-github-advanced](skills/git-github-advanced/SKILL.md) — commit layering, squash-merge
recovery, CI-trigger rules, merge-relocation traps), the owner's merge command
([merge-to-main](skills/merge-to-main/SKILL.md) — "LGTM"), and the scheduling behaviour that is
judgment rather than shape — what a `schedule:` trigger actually guarantees
([github-actions-scheduling](skills/github-actions-scheduling/SKILL.md)).

No prose of its own — the lifecycle checks (`task-lifecycle`, `squash-merge-history`) stay in
`basics`. Every repo gets this pack through `basics`'s `requires` closure (materialized into
declarations at `--init` and the baselining backfill), never by direct seeding.

## Checks

The workflow-YAML and Actions-runner behaviours a repo cannot get wrong. Each rides a check whose
failure message *is* the rule, and each selects its inputs from `.github/workflows/` — so a repo
that ships no workflows hears from none of them.

Most also read `packs/<pack>/stubs/workflows/`, since a stub is copied verbatim into every repo
adopting its pack and is judged there by these same checks. The two that do not are
`gha/no-scheduled-fleet-executor` and `gha/scheduled-failure-escalation`: each asserts a fact
about an adopting repo — who owns its one cron, who watches its scheduled runs — rather than
about the file, so neither has an answer about a fragment. (1)
