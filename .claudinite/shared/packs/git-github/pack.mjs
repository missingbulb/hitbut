// The git/GitHub domain pack: the procedures and owner commands for the
// git/GitHub side of the task lifecycle, bundled as skills
// (skills/git-github-advanced, skills/merge-to-main), plus the workflow-YAML and
// Actions-runner rules — the `gha/` declared checks and the
// skills/github-actions-scheduling skill. Universal reach comes from basics
// naming it in `requires`, so the closure materializes it into every
// declaration — never seeded directly (#385).
//
// THE ACTIONS HALF CARRIES NO FINGERPRINT, and does not need one: every `gha/`
// check selects its inputs with `scanFiles` over `.github/workflows/`, so a repo
// with no workflows hears from none of them. The fingerprint the separate pack
// carried was a second copy of that same fact, kept in a place a repo had to
// re-declare (#1079).
