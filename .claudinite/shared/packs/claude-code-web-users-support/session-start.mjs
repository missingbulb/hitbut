// This pack's session-start step: fetch the current user's personal interaction
// preferences from the store this repo points at, and print them into the session
// context. The engine runs it (engine/pack_loader/run-pack-session-start.mjs) because
// this pack ships the file; it knows nothing about what the file does.
//
// WHY THIS IS A STEP AND NOT PROSE. `RULES.md` is fixed at vendor time and identical
// for every repo and every person that mounts it. What this pack contributes is
// neither: it belongs to the person in front of the session, and it lives in another
// repository entirely. Only something that runs at session start can say it.
//
// WHY THE CONTENT IS NOT HERE. Personal preferences belong to a group of people, not
// to a project and not to the shared canon — which every fleet mounts, and which is
// therefore both the wrong host for one group's preferences and the wrong authority
// on where they live. So this pack carries the ADDRESS (its entry `config`, read via
// store.mjs) and the group carries the content.
//
// LOCAL FIRST. When this tree IS the store, the working copy is what the owner is
// reading and editing — a fetch would serve the default branch and quietly hide the
// edit in progress.
//
// FAIL-SOFT ON EVERY MISS. No identity, no configured store, no file, a fetch that
// fails: one plain-text note, and the session proceeds on default interaction
// behavior. Nothing here is load-bearing — the packs, checks and skills a session
// needs are already local — and a halt directive over a nice-to-have would be a
// pack deciding the session cannot start.
