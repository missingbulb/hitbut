// The barriers pack — enforce a directed folder-access graph. A declared pack
// (no fingerprint: wanting structural segregation is a project's own call, and
// another pack can pull it in via `requires`), it ships one config-driven check
// reading the repo's graph from .claudinite-settings.json `packConfig.barriers`,
// and interprets the fixed barriers other active packs CONTRIBUTE as manifest
// data (contributes: { barriers: [...] } — contributed.mjs builds each into a
// first-class rule). Composition is declaration + configuration, never a code
// import (pack-independence) — the mechanism this pack exists to provide. No
// prose: the finding is the instruction, and the full guide is the README.
//
// Adopting barriers without a graph is a silent no-op, so adoption asks what
// the barriers are FOR (the adoption skill's interview machinery) — the guided on-ramp beats both
// running empty and guessing separations from existing state.
