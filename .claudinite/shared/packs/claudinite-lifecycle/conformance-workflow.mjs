// A member must have SOMETHING in CI that runs the world sweep on every pull
// request — otherwise its own conformance is never gated, and (worse) its
// nightly maintenance PR can never land.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN RULE. `maintenance.delivery: auto-merge` arms GitHub's
// auto-merge, which is a queue for CHECKS. Three shapes exist, and only one
// works:
//
//   no pull_request workflow at all  → the delivery merges directly (#588). Fine.
//   an UNFILTERED conformance flow   → the sweep runs, auto-merge lands on green.
//   a PATH-FILTERED flow             → the arm succeeds, and no check ever runs.
//                                      The PR waits forever. THIS is the trap.
//
// The third shape is invisible: the repo looks like it has CI, `hasPrCi` is
// true, the arm reports success, and the PR simply never lands. TLDR sat in it —
// all three of its test workflows filter to `extension/**`, `server/**`,
// `dev/requirements/**`, so a maintenance PR touching only `.claudinite/**`
// matched nothing. The same filters also hid two blocking `claudinite-isolation`
// findings on its `main` for as long as they had existed.
//
// ADVISORY, DELIBERATELY. Shipping this blocking would turn every member that
// lacks the workflow red on its very next update — which is precisely the
// #555 failure this rule exists to make less likely (a required thing added to
// the canon with no path for consumers to comply first). It becomes blocking
// once the fleet carries the workflow; the promotion is a one-line change here.
//
// RELEVANCE FIRST (engine/checks/README.md): gate on the vendored mount, so this
// is inert in any repo that is not a Claudinite member.
