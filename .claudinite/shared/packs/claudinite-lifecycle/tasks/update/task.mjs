// basics task: update — the versioned engine/pack update flows, run by a repo on
// itself (#768 — see the versioned-updates design there). The successor to `baselining`,
// and for now its sibling: exactly one of the two serves any repo, decided by that
// repo's own `maintenance.mechanism` (engine/served-by.mjs).
//
// A repo that has not been flipped declares nothing, is served by baselining, and
// never reaches this task's worker — which stands down in that case rather than
// assuming. So adding this task changes nothing for a member until someone writes
// the flag into its declaration.
//
// Two stages, like baselining's. The DETERMINISTIC flows are `code_work`
// (worker.mjs): they converge the mount, run the version-ranged migrations, gate on
// the converged tree's self-test, open the PR, and act on the terminal. The AGENT
// stage runs only when the pack flow's apply stage is needed — the pack's new rules
// meeting member-authored content the canon has never seen.
//
// Self-contained (imports nothing) so the scheduler, executor, and a human all load
// it standalone — the whole contract lives in this default export.
