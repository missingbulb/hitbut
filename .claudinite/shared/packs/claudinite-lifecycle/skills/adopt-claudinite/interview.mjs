// Adoption interviews — the mandatory questions a pack asks when a project
// adopts it. A pack that needs the project's INTENT before it can provide value
// (a research wiki with no subject is a silent no-op) declares its questions in an
// optional `questions` field on its pack.mjs:
//
//   questions: [{ id: 'goals', prompt: '…', distill: '…' }]
//
// Stable-id'd, because the answers live VERBATIM on the pack's entry in
// .claudinite-settings.json (`answers: { "<question-id>": "<answer>" }` — see
// engine/checks/README.md): the settings file records the project's intent beside the
// `config` distilled from it. The GAP — declared question ids minus answered
// ids — drives the asking: at adoption every question is pending; when the
// canon later adds a question to a pack, just that one surfaces in every
// consumer; a pack with no questions adds nothing. An answered question stays
// answered — "n/a, none wanted" is an answer, distinct from never-asked.
//
//   node interview.mjs check   SessionStart step: when active packs have
//                              unanswered questions, emit a MILD context note
//                              asking the assistant to interview the owner at a
//                              natural moment — and telling an unattended
//                              session to ignore it entirely. Deliberately
//                              never a conformance finding: a nightly run must
//                              not be blocked on a question nobody is present
//                              to answer. Strictness lives only in the
//                              bootstrap adoption flow (bootstrap.md Part 2),
//                              where the owner is present by construction.
