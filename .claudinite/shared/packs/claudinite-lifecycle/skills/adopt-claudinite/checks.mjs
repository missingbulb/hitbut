// Adoption-interview hygiene, owned by the pack that owns the interview. A STORED
// answer whose question the pack no longer declares (renamed or removed upstream)
// is a stale intent that silently stops matching — advisory, never run-failing,
// so a canon-side question rename can't fail the fleet's CI overnight. This is a
// claudinite-growth concern, not the engine's: it rides this pack's activation
// like any skill-owned check, so a repo without the lifecycle pack never runs it
// (and the engine imports no pack to do so).
//
// PENDING questions are deliberately NOT a finding — they surface only as the
// mild SessionStart note (interview.mjs `check`), so an unattended run is never
// blocked on a question nobody is present to answer. A MALFORMED `questions`
// declaration is a manifest load fault the pack registry reports, not here.
//
// Reads ctx.packs (the discovered pack objects the runner attaches) so the check
// runs synchronously without re-discovering packs.
