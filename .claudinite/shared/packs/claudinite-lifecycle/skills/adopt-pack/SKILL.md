name: adopt-pack
description: Add one or more packs to an already-adopted Claudinite member — declare, run each pack's adoption interview, re-vendor, scaffold, land. Use when asked to adopt, add, enable, or declare a pack (e.g. product-wiki, executable-requirements) on a repo that already runs Claudinite.
---

Turn one or more packs on: declare, answer what the pack asks, materialize its content, satisfy what
it now demands. The declaration is authoritative — declaring is the project's call. Whole-repo
bootstrap and the on-demand refresh are [adopt-claudinite](../adopt-claudinite/SKILL.md)'s.

## 1. Declare

The full directory of adoptable packs — every canon pack with what it covers, how it activates,
and what it requires — is vendored in the mount at `.claudinite/shared/packs/directory.GENERATED.md`
(canon-side: `packs/directory.GENERATED.md`); read it when choosing, or when the owner asks what
could be added. **Match the owner's plain-words name to a pack id yourself** before asking them to
disambiguate — pack ids rarely read like how people describe them, so read the candidate's entry
there and confirm the fit.

Add each chosen pack's id to `packs` in `.claudinite-settings.json`. A pack that only makes sense
alongside another names it in `requires`; `resolveDeclaredPacks` pulls that closure in when the
declaration is written, so you declare what you *chose* and its dependencies follow (e.g.
`spec-driven-product` pulls `executable-requirements`). An unknown pack name — or an unknown
property on an entry — is a blocking **settings** error, not a conformance finding; fix the name.

## 2. Interview — the part that is easy to skip and must not be

A pack that needs the project's intent before it can provide value declares `questions` on its
manifest (see [packs/README.md](../../../README.md) and the machinery in
[../adopt-claudinite/interview.mjs](../adopt-claudinite/interview.mjs)). For **every** newly
declared pack that asks questions:

- Where a question says the repo may already hold the answer (a product brief, an existing
  requirements doc, the issue tracker), **read that first and confirm** rather than asking cold.
- Otherwise ask the owner directly (`AskUserQuestion`), one question at a time, at the point of
  adoption — when a human asked for the adoption, they are present by construction.
- Record each answer **verbatim** on that pack's entry as `answers: { "<question-id>": "<text>" }`.
  `"n/a — none wanted"` is a valid answer and stops the asking. Where the question carries a
  `distill` note, derive the entry's `config` from the answer (e.g. `executable-requirements`'s
  spec path → `config.spec`).

### When nobody is there to ask

Adoption also runs **unattended** — a scheduled task acting on a recommendation, the
fleet-add-missing-packs task's agent stage, any run with no human in the loop. The interview is then the hard stop, and
the order matters:

1. **Never guess an answer, and never leave the question unrecorded.** A pack whose question is
   answered by inference carries a decision nobody made, in a file that then propagates by
   `requires` closure and outlives whoever could have corrected it. `"n/a"` is an *owner's* answer,
   not a default you may write on their behalf.
2. **Finish everything the question does not gate, first** — declare, re-vendor, refresh the badge
   row, scaffold, and get the checks green (§4, §5). Stopping at the question with a red repo hands
   the owner a broken tree *and* a question; stopping with a green one hands them only the question.
3. **Then stop, and hand off in the open.** Open the PR with what is settled, name each unanswered
   question in the PR body under a heading that says the adoption is incomplete, and say the same
   on whatever issue prompted the run. Do **not** merge, do not proceed to a next pack's interview,
   and do not re-run the adoption on a later firing hoping the answer appeared — an unanswered
   question is a human's, and re-asking it weekly is nagging.

A pack that asks nothing adopts fully unattended; this section costs it nothing.

## 3. Re-vendor

The new packs' prose, checks, and skills must land under the tracked `.claudinite/shared/` mount,
**and the repo must be stamped with the version it is now at.** Fetch a fresh canon to scratch and
run its install runner against the checkout — sessions never fetch:

```
node <canon>/updates/install.mjs --target . <pack-id> [<pack-id>…]
```

**Do not hand-roll this with `apply-vendor-set.mjs`.** It lays the files down correctly and does one
thing that nothing notices for weeks: it stamps **every declared pack** at the newest version,
whether or not the records between were ever applied. `migrationApplies` is `want > have`, so once
the stamp reaches a record's own version that record stops applying — not for this cycle, but
permanently. Re-vendoring a repo to add one pack therefore silently burns every pending record for
the packs it *already* had, and the repo is left claiming a version whose shape it was never
migrated into.

That is correct behaviour at version zero, where there is no older state to skip; it is wrong
everywhere else, and adding a pack to a live repo is everywhere else.

The runner declares each pack, vendors its content, stamps it and every pack in its `requires`
closure at the newest version, runs any one-shot seed ops, and gates on the converged tree's own
self-test. It exits non-zero on a refusal or an unanswered interview — a pack already installed is
**refused**, because reinstalling would restamp the repo to the newest version while skipping every
record in between.

Then **refresh the README pack-badge row**, from the mount you just rebuilt:

```
node .claudinite/shared/engine/converge-wiring.mjs <owner/repo> --badges
```

Declaring a pack is what makes that row wrong, and adoption is the only moment anything derives it —
the nightly deliberately leaves a repo's README alone, so a row not refreshed here stays stale until
someone notices by eye. The converge rewrites the row in place between its
`<!-- claudinite:packs -->` markers, keeping whatever the repo wrote after the closing one, and is a
no-op when the row is already right. A repo that has deleted its row keeps it deleted only if you
skip this — dropping the row is a real choice, so don't re-seed one the repo removed on purpose.

**Adopting `claudinite-tasks` also scaffolds the two workflow files** — the scheduler run with
its drain, and the label-event executor:

```
node .claudinite/shared/packs/claudinite-tasks/converge-workflows.mjs <owner/repo>
```

`.github/workflows/` is the one directory a member's nightly may never push to, so these arrive
here or not at all. They are static from this moment: the cron minute is hashed from the repo's
full name, both anchor hours come from its `taskScheduler.dailyHour`, and every `run:` names a
mount path behind which the code converges nightly. The command is a no-op when both files are
already right. A repo adopting this pack also needs its two CCR routine endpoints — the executor's
and the work-item session's — pointed at `executor.md` and `queue/instructions.md` in its own
mount; that is a console setting, so it belongs in the handover issue §4b files.

## 4. Scaffold what the pack now demands

A newly active pack may require structure the repo doesn't have yet — deliberately, so the
declaration is a statement of intent that its own findings then guide you to satisfy. Run the
world sweep and let each finding name the file: e.g. `product-wiki` wants its index and the
reviewed `product-requirements/` sink before the isolation wall has anything to guard. Scaffold
per the pack's own README template; the pack's rules are the checklist.

## 4b. File what adoption cannot do

A pack may declare `adoptionHandover` — steps only a human can perform (a repository or
console setting, a permission, a secret). The install runner prints them; they are not
optional and they are not PR-body notes. **Open one tracking issue per adopting repo**,
a checkbox per step, written per
[writing-handover-issues](../../../basics/skills/writing-handover-issues/SKILL.md) — so
each step's `breaks` (what is broken while it is off) and `done` (its closing condition)
travel in the section below the checklist, never between the boxes. Per-repo manual work reliably does not happen,
so an unfiled step is a capability that dies silently in that member.

Say on the adoption PR that the issue exists and link it. If the repo already has an
open issue for the same steps, comment there rather than opening a second.

## 5. Land

World and work checks green (`.claudinite/shared/engine/checks/check_the_world.mjs`; the Stop hook
carries the work checks). Commit referencing the task's issue, push, open one PR. Content a pack
seeds through this flow — a `product-wiki` wiki's first researched, cited pages — rides the same
review gate as any other change; it is never pushed straight to the default branch.

**A failing check is your work, not the reviewer's.** Declaring a pack is what switched those rules
on, so every finding they now produce belongs to this change — fix it here, in the repo, before the
PR opens. Two things that are *not* fixes: silencing a rule by adding it to `rules`/`accept` in
`.claudinite-settings.json`, and undeclaring the pack to make the findings stop. Both turn a real
signal off on the repo's first exposure to it. If a finding genuinely cannot be satisfied — the pack
demands structure this repo has decided against — that is evidence the pack is **not** the right fit:
drop it from the declaration, say why on the PR, and let the smaller adoption land.

**Never leave the repo red.** Whatever stops you — a check you cannot satisfy, an unanswered
interview question, a scaffold that needs a decision — get the tree green first and open the PR on
what is settled. An incomplete adoption in a green repo is a handoff; an incomplete adoption in a
red one is a bug report against you.
