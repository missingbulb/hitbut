// The scheduler's GitHub WRITES — the small set of issue mutations both dispatch
// mechanisms make, over the injected `gh` reader from signals/gh.mjs. Reads live
// with their callers; these are here so the slot machinery and the work-item queue
// share one implementation of each, rather than two that drift.
//
// LABEL WRITES ARE GRANULAR, ALWAYS (tasks-dispatch DESIGN §4, RESEARCH §2): add
// and remove NAMED labels (POST/DELETE), never write the label SET (PUT). A
// set-write replaces from a stale snapshot and clobbers concurrent transitions —
// a bug class GitHub's own CLI shipped (cli/cli#4861) — and with a scheduler run and
// several executors all moving labels at once, that is a correctness rule rather
// than a style preference.

// Ensure every label exists before any is applied. Load-bearing, not cosmetic:
// GitHub does not create a label when you apply one (the issues API 422s on an
// unknown label), so the thing that assigns a label must guarantee it first.
// Idempotent (201 created / 422 already exists are both success) and self-healing
// — a deleted label reappears on the next run.

      // POST 422s forever. So reconcile the shape, not just the existence — that
