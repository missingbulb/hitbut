// WHEN A BLOCKED ITEM MAY RUN, and who releases it (tasks-dispatch DESIGN §9,

// scheduler run, hourly, over every open item; and whoever CLOSES an item, immediately,
// over the dependents that item was holding. The predicate lives here so those
// two can never answer it differently — the failure that shape produces is a
// chain link that waits an hour on one path and runs at once on the other, with
// nothing red to say which is right.
//
// The scheduler run stays the backstop, deliberately: a close performed by a HUMAN (or by
// a session that stopped early) runs none of this, and the hourly pass is what
// makes that harmless rather than a chain that never resumes.
