// The executor's entry gate: identify the ONE dispatch this session was started
// for, and validate it in code BEFORE any model judgment (per-project-scheduling
// DESIGN §5.2). This is the CLI shell `validate-dispatch.mjs` was written to be
// driven by — it wires that pure core's `exists` / `isPackDeclared` / `loadTask`
// capabilities to this checkout and hands it the issue body.
//
// IT DOES NOT CLAIM. The claim protocol (read labels → swap ready → agent-running
// → post a claim comment → re-read, earliest claim wins) needs GitHub WRITES,
// which the executor session can only make through its MCP tools, so it stays
// agent-driven prose in executor.md. This shell only decides "is there a dispatch
// here, is it mine, and is it legal".
//
// TWO TRIGGER SOURCES, because the same `issues.labeled` webhook reaches an
// executor session by two different transports and only one of them was ever
// read here:
//
//   1. GITHUB ACTIONS writes the whole webhook payload to disk at
//      `$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH` — `action`, `label.name` and the entire `issue`
//      object, `issue.number` and `issue.body` included. Payload plus local
//      checkout is everything the validation needs, in one shot.
//   2. CLAUDE CODE ON THE WEB (CCR) delivers the same trigger as environment
//      variables instead — `CCR_TRIGGER_SOURCE`, `CCR_TRIGGER_EVENT`,
//      `CCR_TRIGGER_REPO`, `CCR_TRIGGER_ISSUE_NUMBER` — and writes no payload
//      file at all. It NAMES the issue but carries neither the label that was
//      added nor the body, so it resolves in two shots: this shell reports
//      `needs-issue` with the number, the executor fetches that one issue over
//      MCP, saves the tool's raw JSON response verbatim to a file, and
//      re-invokes with `--issue-json` for the identical validation. The shell
//      extracts body, labels, and title from the response itself — the agent
//      pastes bytes, it never hand-extracts fields — and rejects a response
//      whose `number` is not the trigger's, so fetching the wrong issue is
//      caught in code. (`--issue-body-file` + `--issue-labels` remain as the
//      manual fallback should the fetch's response shape ever surprise.)
//
// Reading only source 1 is what made every CCR-run executor session miss its own
// trigger and select an issue by listing instead — the duplicate-execution bug
// re-entered through the front door. Observed live 2026-07-28: two sessions each
// selected dispatch #772 and claimed it one second apart.
//
// ZERO NETWORK, BY CONSTRUCTION — still. The executor session is MCP-only and
// carries no repo credential of its own, so anything reaching the GitHub REST API
// here would both fail to authenticate and trip the in-session-github-access
// rule. The CCR path does not change that: this shell never fetches the issue
// itself, it tells the EXECUTOR to fetch it over MCP and hand the bytes back.
//
// THE VERDICT IS THE INTERFACE; THE EXIT CODE IS ONLY "did the routine break".
// The executor branches on the printed `dispatch:` field, which every decided
// verdict carries. The exit code answers a narrower question, and answers it the
// way every other command does (owner, 2026-08-14): ZERO WHEN THE ROUTINE GOES
// ON — including when going on means stopping on purpose — and NON-ZERO ONLY
// WHEN IT STOPS UNEXPECTEDLY. A verdict this shell was written to reach is not a
// failure, and a harness that paints exit 11 red teaches both the reader and the
// agent to read an ordinary "not mine" as a fault.
//
// Exit 0, `dispatch:` names which one:
//
//   valid       — a legal dispatch for this session's scope; go claim it.
//   needs-issue — a CCR trigger named the issue but carries no body/labels.
//                 Fetch THAT issue over MCP and re-invoke with them. The routine
//                 is mid-handshake, not stopped.
//   invalid     — a forged or mangled dispatch. Comment the printed `reason`,
//                 remove the ready label, add `needs-human` + `task:needs-human-failure`,
//                 end the session.
//                 It never runs. Prescribed work, so: zero.
//   task-gone   — a well-formed dispatch naming a task this repo no longer
//                 carries (file removed, pack undeclared). CLOSE the issue
//                 with the printed reason (owner, 2026-08-06) — an obsolete
//                 dispatch is not a human's problem. It never runs.
//   not-mine    — the trigger label is no ready label at all, or the issue no
//                 longer carries one (a dispatch another session has already
//                 claimed). Stop. Change nothing, comment nothing. An expected
//                 stop is not an error.
//
// Non-zero — the routine stops and something needs a human:
//
//   12 no-trigger      — NO source names an issue. STOP THE SESSION. There is no
//                        fallback: never select a dispatch by listing (see below).
//   15 scope-mismatch  — the trigger label is the OTHER executor's ready label.
//                        Each routine fires on its own label, so this is a
//                        MISCONFIGURED ROUTINE (a fleet routine whose prompt lost
//                        the word `fleet`, most often), not a dispatch to adopt.
//                        Stop — change nothing, comment nothing — but stop LOUDLY:
//                        nothing on GitHub records this, the janitor re-arms the
//                        dispatch, and it declines forever until a human reads it.
//   2  usage           — bad invocation (an unknown scope argument, an unreadable
//                        `--issue-body-file`).
//   1  internal        — an unexpected fault in this shell.
//
// Codes 10, 11, 13 and 14 are RETIRED, not renumbered — every one of them now
// exits 0 under its own `dispatch:` name, and no live code carries a changed
// meaning for a reader who remembers the old table.
//
// THERE IS NO FALLBACK, BY DESIGN. Exit 12 used to send the executor off to list
// the open dispatches and take the oldest. That is precisely the
// N-sessions-racing-over-N-issues failure the one-session-one-issue rule exists to
// prevent, reached from the other direction: one scheduler run files every due
// dispatch seconds apart, so every session that cannot name its own trigger builds
// the SAME work list and races over it. A session that does not know its issue
// must run nothing — the daily task-janitor re-arms an unrun dispatch,
// so stopping costs a delay while guessing costs duplicated work.
//
// Usage: `node <engine>/scheduler/resolve-dispatch.mjs [self|fleet]`
//                `[--issue-json <path> | --issue-body-file <path> --issue-labels <csv>]`
// The positional argument is THIS SESSION's scope — which of the two executor
// routines is running. It defaults to `self`, which is every ordinary project's
// executor; the FLEET routine must pass `fleet` explicitly, and a fleet payload
// arriving at a session that did not is reported as not-mine with that stated
// plainly. The flags carry what a CCR trigger cannot, and are ignored on the
// Actions path (whose payload already has everything).
