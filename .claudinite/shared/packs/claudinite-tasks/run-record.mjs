// scheduler's own line, one per due task per run; the slot scheduler is retired
// (#974) and nothing writes that line any more. The parser stays, and only the
// parser: Actions logs from before the retirement are still inside their retention
// window, and the usage fold still counts them. Nothing new should be taught this
// shape — `claudinite-task-exec` below is the live record.
//
// The counts these produce are exact within the Actions log retention window, and
// that is worth stating next to the capture-derived counts they land beside.

// The five things a slot scheduler run could do with a due task. One name per
// outcome, used verbatim as the counter key in the aggregate, so there is no
// mapping table between "what the run said" and "what the fold counted" to drift.

  // constrained to the line format's `[a-z-]+` charset.
