// The `fleet` signal reader (per-project-scheduling DESIGN §3.3) — the members
// aggregate the CANON repo's fleet-scoped tasks (growth-promote,
// growth-discover-packs) decide from. A consumer cannot
// declare `fleet`; only the canon repo's scheduler builds it, over the fleet PAT
// (`FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN` — the census's existing credential, the one token that
// can enumerate every repo the owner owns; the Action's default GITHUB_TOKEN sees
// only this repo). queue/signals.mjs invokes this ONLY when the picked task declares `fleet`, so
// an ordinary night pays nothing for the fleet enumeration.
//
// Pure over an injected `fleetGh` (the same `gh(path) -> { status, json }` shape
// the other collectors take), so the whole reader tests against a fake `gh` with
// no live GitHub — exactly like signals/index.mjs. The one place the real
// FLEET_GITHUB_TOKEN is read is `makeFleetGh`, at the I/O edge.
//
// This deliberately ports the retired central planner's per-member probes (the
// `fleetMembers` bundle the old central planner stamped on the home repo) into
// the per-repo scheduler, adapted for the `local/packs` rename (both roots
// accepted through the migration) and carrying each member's provenance stamp so
// the retire guard can read per-repo apply evidence.
