// A task's code may read only the CLAUDINITE_* variables code-work is actually
// handed (`codeWorkEnv`, tasks-dispatch DESIGN §6.5). Anything else is a variable
// nobody sets, which fails in the one way nothing catches: `process.env.X` is
// `undefined`, the worker's parse of it yields an empty result, and the run goes
// green having quietly done something other than what it was asked.
//
// That is not hypothetical. Three fleet tasks took their parameters through
// `CLAUDINITE_OVERRIDES`, the slot scheduler's manual-run bag, which the queue has
// never set — so `REPOS` could not bound a sweep and `DRY_RUN` could not withhold
// its writes, and every run of the fleet-wide baseline lever was unscoped and live
// (#974). A dropped parameter channel defaults to the operation's most dangerous
// mode, not a safe one.
//
// GENERIC BY CONSTRUCTION: the legal set is the key set of the object the executor
// builds, imported rather than restated, so a variable added to or removed from the
// code-work contract changes what this accepts with no edit here.
// A task's own code. Tests are out: a test naming a retired variable is naming it
// as a fixture, which is exactly what a regression test for this rule must be free
// to do.
